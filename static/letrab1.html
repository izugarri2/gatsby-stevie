Close your eyes, beddy bye tin soldier,<br>
Mommy says that it's time for sleep,<br>
If my folks were wiser and older,<br>
They'd know kids and toys don't need sleep.<br>
<br>
Don't be bad little cotton dolly,<br>
See how nice Mickey Mouse sleeps now?<br>
Even my brass drummer boy has stopped all his noise,<br>
Cause he knows it's past bedtime for toys.<br>
<br>
(Speaking)<br>
Ya know, every Christmas Santa Claus goes all over the world with his reindeer,<br>
sled, and a big bag of toys and he'll come to your house this year too.<br>
But sometimes, just sometimes, he doesn't have enough time to see every little boy and girl because the world is so big.<br>
So maybe we should sing a song for all the children that Santa didn't visit.<br>
<br>
Bless the child who has no tin soldier,<br>
No brass drummer boy to put to bed.<br>
He will still grow wiser and older,<br>
Loving one small rag doll instead.<br>
<br>
He won't have a cotton dolly,<br>
Mickey Mouse won't come to his house.<br>
Hold that rag doll to your heart, nothing can destroy<br>
The beauty one shall find in one small toy<br>

Seeing me go nowhere,<br>

Children dying everyday,<br>
My name is nobody<br>
But I can't wait to see your face inside my door.<br>

Your name is big brother<br>
You say that you got me all in your notebook,<br>
Writing it down everyday,<br>
Your name is I'll see ya,<br>
I'll change if you vote me in as the pres,<br>
The President of your soul<br>
I live in the ghetto,<br>
You just come to visit me 'round election time.<br>
<br>
I live in the ghetto,<br>
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side,<br>
My name is secluded, we live in a house the size of a matchbox,<br>
Roaches live with us wall to wall,<br>

You've killed all our leaders,<br>
I don't even have to do nothin' to you,<br>
You'll cause your own country to fall.<br>

A flake of snow within a storm<br>
A new way waiting to be born<br>
In a world with need of change<br>
A touch of love in fear of hate<br>
A rushing wind that's asked to wait<br>
For the promises of rain<br>
A pearl of wisdom entrapped by poverty<br>
<br>
She gives love with purity<br>
Filling minds with hopeful schemes<br>
To build worlds enhanced by peace<br>
Draped in sparkling morning dew<br>
She expresses life anew<br>
From the earth beneath her feet<br>
She is a flower that grows<br>
In love ability<br>
She's femininity<br>
<br>
Black Orchid, Black Orchid<br>
Why did they make you begin<br>
When they know in time you'll find your truth<br>
before your cycle ends<br>
Black Orchid, Black Orchid<br>
Why are you crying their fears<br>
When the true reflection of you that they see<br>
Is love besieged by years<br>
<br>
She has touched the farthest star<br>
Her beauty speaks of what we are<br>
And her freedom makes us free<br>
Her now is in eternity<br>
Infinite to all that see<br>
And her dreams have been achieved<br>
Now there is a sound of laughter<br>
Nature signs out her name<br>
For the world to know her fame<br>
<br>
Black Orchid, Black Orchid<br>
Why did they criticize<br>
When they knew your love could cast its spell and<br>
consecrate their eyes<br>
Black Orchid, Black Orchid<br>
Why do you linger in space<br>
When you know in every heart that beats<br>
You hold a special place<br>
When you know in every heart that beats<br>
You hold a special place<br>

Where has my love gone?<br>
How can I go on?<br>
It seems dear love has gone away.<br>
<br>
Where is my spirit?<br>
I'm nowhere near it,<br>
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.<br>
<br>
But I'll blame it on the sun,<br>
The sun that didn't shine,<br>
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees.<br>
<br>
I'll blame it on the time that never was enough,<br>
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea,<br>
But, my heart blames it on me.<br>
<br>
Who poured the love out?<br>
What made this bitter doubt?<br>
Is peace not here for me to see?<br>
<br>
Wish I could tell you,<br>
But, words won't come for me to speak.<br>
<br>
But I'll blame it on the sun,<br>
That didn't fill the sky,<br>
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees.<br>
<br>
I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon,<br>
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be,<br>
But, my heart blames it on me.<br>

She would always win the fight<br>

Girl I've been crying ever since you left<br>
My mama told me get a hold of yourself and<br>
Be Cool, Be Calm And Keep Yourself Together<br>
She said<br>
Be Cool, Be Calm And Keep Yourself Together<br>
<br>
Sugar plum you really gone<br>
And it just don't help to cry<br>
So I wipe my tears away the other day<br>
And hung my handkerchief up to dry<br>
<br>
Then I changed my style put on a smile<br>
And went out to face the world<br>
The smile I wear say ha I don't care<br>
That I just lost my girl<br>
<br>
But I still get that old yearning<br>
Can't be cool when my heart is burning<br>
I still get that old feeling<br>
Can't be calm when my head is reeling<br>
<br>
I say, Mother dear, see here see here<br>
Tell me now what shall I do<br>
Can't have that girl and I love her true<br>
She said but babes give up be man enough<br>
<br>
To Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together<br>
That what my mama said<br>
Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together<br>
<br>
Sugar pie you said goodbye<br>
And I cried myself to sleep<br>
That's when my mama said<br>
Don't loose your head son<br>
It just don't help to weep<br>
<br>
Now I'm the great pretender<br>
I don't surrender<br>
To what I feel inside<br>
I'm the life of the crowd<br>
And ha I love fun lots<br>
But it's a big disguise<br>
<br>
'Cause I still hear my heart pounding<br>
Hard to be cool when you come around me<br>
I still hear my heart purring<br>
Hard to ne calm when my inside's stirring<br>
<br>
I say, Mother dear, see here see here<br>
Tell me now what way to go<br>
Can't have that girl and I love her so<br>
She said whenever you're blue whatever you do<br>
<br>
Be Cool, Calm And Keep Yourself Together<br>

There is a dance that they do on the beach, yeah<br>
It's called the beach stomp<br>
And it's done with the feet, yeah<br>
Well you kick just a little sand<br>
Then you grab your partner by the hand<br>
<br>
Catch a wave on the run<br>
You're doing the beachstomp, yeah<br>
<br>
Place your surf<br>
Down to your side<br>
They catch a big wave<br>
Then begin to ride, yeah<br>
But you grab a real tight grip<br>
Get ready for the great big dip<br>
<br>
Come on yeah and do the beachstomp with me<br>
Yeah Yeah ah Yeah<br>
<br>
Now the boys are there<br>
With their transistor radios<br>
And all of the girls<br>
Are in their polka dot bikinis<br>
<br>
If you wanna swing until two<br>
I'll tell you what you can do<br>
Grab a chick by the hand<br>
ANd do the beachstomp<br>

Somewhere beyond the sea<br>
Somewhere waiting for me<br>
My lover stands on golden sands<br>
And watches the ships that go sailin'<br>
<br>
Somewhere beyond the sea<br>
She's there watching for me<br>
If I could fly like birds on high<br>
Then straight to her arms<br>
I'd go sailin'<br>
<br>
It's far beyond the stars<br>
It's near beyond the moon<br>
I know beyond a doubt<br>
My heart will lead me there soon<br>
<br>
We'll meet beyond the shore<br>
We'll kiss just as before<br>
Happy we'll be beyond the sea<br>
And never again I'll go sailin'<br>
<br>
I know beyond a doubt<br>
My heart will lead me there soon<br>
We'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore<br>
We'll kiss just as before<br>
Happy we'll be beyond the sea<br>
And never again I'll go sailin'.<br>
