Shattered dreams, worthless years,<br>
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell,<br>
Life began, then was done,<br>
Now I stare into a cold and empty well.<br>
The many sounds that meet our ears, the sights our eyes behold,<br>
Will open up our merging hearts,<br>
And feed our empty souls.<br>
<br>
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever,<br>
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.<br>
<br>
Without despair we will share,<br>
And the joys of caring will not be replaced,<br>
What has been must never end<br>
And with the strength we have won't be erased,<br>
When the truths of love are planted firm,<br>
They won't be hard to find,<br>
And the words of love I speak to you will echo in your mind.<br>
<br>
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever,<br>
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever.<br>
<br>
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever,<br>
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever.<br>
<br>
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again,<br>
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again.<br>
<br>
God surely answered my prayer,<br>
God surely answered by prayer,<br>
You know God surely answered my prayer,<br>
You know God surely answered my prayer,<br>
God always will answer your prayers,<br>
Believe in one who will answer my prayer,<br>
Thank you God.<br>
<br>
Come on, let's fall in love,<br>
You're the woman I've been waiting for,<br>
Come on, let's fall in love,<br>
You're the girl that I really adore,<br>
Come on, let's fall in love... .<br>

I can't let my heaven walk away<br>
Just cant let my heaven walk away<br>
Just gotta find a way to make her stay<br>
I don't know what I've done wrong<br>
Look up and find my heaven gone<br>
<br>
Called her name but I called in vain<br>
I know she can't answer from a picture frame<br>
Only an hour ago I held her in real flesh and blood<br>
She just grabbed her coat and said<br>
please I've had enough<br>
<br>
She kept me well like a Sunday prayer<br>
Just like my own right hand the girl was always there<br>
To every man but me her eyes were blind<br>
I was in the promise land long before my time<br>
<br>
I can't let my heaven walk away<br>
Just cant let my heaven walk away<br>
Just gotta find a way to make her stay<br>

Cheatin ways with another guy<br>
You laugh in my face<br>

You made me crawl on<br>
This cold black earth, baby<br>
No I never, I never knew<br>
How much love could hurt<br>
Until I loved you baby<br>
Till I loved you baby, baby<br>
Oh baby, I can't stop<br>
I can't stop crying can't you see<br>
Here I'm pleadin on my knees<br>

Won't you help me, help me please<br>
Cause I love you, I love you baby<br>

Oh baby, I don't know, I don't know<br>
Nobody can do nothing about it<br>

<div align=left><font size="3" color=#CCFFFF>
I took a worthless trip<br>
Down life's avenue<br>
Just to try to find a way to smile again<br>
While I was on my way<br>
I met a wise man who said<br>
That happiness you only find within<br>
I learned my lesson then<br>
<br>
So I go sailing<br>
Through the rivers of my mind<br>
I go sailing<br>
Be surprised what you can find<br>
I go sailing<br>
Through the rivers of my mind<br>
Take a chance on your mind<br>
Be surprised what you'll find<br>
<br>
I took a friend's advice<br>
Who said go up and away<br>
Take the magic of a mystery tour<br>
But I felt so all alone<br>
Though I could almost touch the stars<br>
I started missing things I touched before<br>
The tour was such a bore<br>
<br>
So I go sailing<br>
Through the rivers of my mind<br>
I go sailing<br>
Be surprised what you can find<br>
I go sailing<br>
Through the rivers of my mind<br>
Take a chance on your mind<br>
Be surprised what you'll find<br>

Got no place to be<br>
No one's needing me<br>
My girl just said we're through<br>
Love was here to stay<br>
Only yesterday<br>
Today my world is blue<br>
<br>
So show me to where there's music<br>
Show me to where there's music<br>
With music I just might go on.......<br>
I gotta have a song......<br>
To go it alone.......<br>
A happy happy song...<br>
<br>
Had a happy home<br>
Now it's turned to stone<br>
Kitchen's cold and bare<br>
She'd cook all day for me<br>
I still hurry home to see<br>
But I know that she's not there<br>

<div align=left><font size="3" color=#CCFFFF>
No new years's day<br>
to celebrate<br>
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away<br>
no first of spring<br>
no song to sing<br>
in fact here's just another ordinary day<br>
No April rain<br>
no flowers bloom<br>
no wedding saturday within the month of June<br>
But what it is<br>
Is something true<br>
Made up of these three words that I must say to you<br>
I just called to say I love you<br>
I just called to say how much I care<br>
I just called to say I love you<br>
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart<br>
<br>
No summer's high<br>
No warm July<br>
No harvest moon to light one tender August night<br>
No autumn breeze<br>
No falling leaves<br>
No even time for birds to fly to southern skies<br>
No libra sun<br>
No Halloween<br>
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring<br>
But what it is<br>
Though old so new<br>
To fill your heart like no three words Could ever do.<br>
<br>
I just called to say I love you<br>
I just called to say how much I care<br>
I just called to say I love you<br>
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.<br>
<br>
I just called to say I love you<br>
I just called to say how much I care<br>
I just called to say I love you<br>
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart<br>
<br>
Of my heart<br>
Of my heart<br>

Oh, when you say those words of love to me<br>
I know you know you make me feel so good inside<br>
But if by break of day you never can stay<br>
There must be something in our love that I don't know about that you<br>
Feel you've got to hide<br>

Baby, baby, you make me feel like you care a lot<br>

Don't leave my heart a broken glass baby, oh oh<br>
Sometimes I feel like I love you<br>
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you<br>

I was born in Lil' Rock,<br>
Had a childhood sweetheart,<br>
We were always hand in hand.<br>
<br>
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails,<br>
Suzy was in pig tails,<br>
I know I loved her even then.<br>
<br>
You know my papa disapproved it,<br>
My mama boohooed it,<br>
But I told them time and time again,<br>
"Don't you know I was made to love her,<br>
Built a world all around her"<br>
Yah! Hey, hey, hey.<br>
<br>
She's been my inspiration,<br>
Showed appreciation<br>
For the love I gave her through the years.<br>
<br>
Like a sweet magnolia tree<br>
My love blossmed tenderly,<br>
My life grew sweeter through the years.<br>
<br>
I know that my baby loves me,<br>
My baby needs me,<br>
That's why we made it through the years.<br>
<br>
I was made to love her,<br>
Worship and adore her,<br>
Hey, hey, hey.<br>
<br>
All through thick and thin<br>
Our love just won't end,<br>
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!<br>
<br>
My baby loves me,<br>
My baby needs me,<br>
And I know I ain't going nowhere.<br>
<br>
I was knee high to a chicken<br>
When that love bug bit me,<br>
I had the fever with each passing year.<br>
<br>
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles,<br>
If this whole world crumbles,<br>
By her side I'll still be standing there.<br>
<br>
'Cause I was made to love her,<br>
I was made to live for her, yeah!<br>
<br>
Ah, I was made to love her,<br>
Built my world all around her,<br>
Hey, hey, hey.<br>
<br>
Oo baby, I was made to please her,<br>
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no,<br>
Hey, hey, hey.<br>
<br>
Oo wee baby, my baby loves me,<br>
My baby needs me,<br>
Hey, hey, hey.<br>
<br>
OO my baby loves me.<br>

Looking back on when I<br>
Was a little nappy headed boy<br>
Then my only worry<br>
Was for Christmas what would be my toy<br>
Even though we sometimes<br>
Would not get a thing<br>
We were happy with the<br>
Joy the day would bring<br>
<br>
Sneaking out the back door<br>
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine<br>
Greeted at the back door<br>
With "boy thought I told you not to go outside,"<br>
Tryin' your best to bring the<br>
Water to your eyes<br>
Thinkin' it might stop her<br>
From woopin' your behind<br>
<br>
I wish those days could come back once more<br>
Why did those days ev-er have to go<br>
I wish those days could come back once more<br>
Why did those days ev-er have to go<br>
Cause I love them so<br>
<br>
Brother says he's tellin'<br>
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl<br>
Just don't tell I'll give you<br>
Anything you want in this whole wide world<br>
Mama gives you money for Sunday school<br>
You trade yours for candy after church is through<br>
<br>
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)<br>
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall<br>
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right<br>
But while you were doin'it-it sure felt outta sight<br>
<br>
I wish those days could come back once more<br>
Why did those days ev-er have to go<br>
I wish those days could come back once more<br>
Why did those days ev-er have to go<br>

They say your love will surely fade girl<br>
When things go wrong and trouble calls<br>
But they don't know that your sweet sunshine babe<br>
Will never fade when darkness falls<br>
They say that when the chips are down girl<br>
Your love won't stay so long my friend<br>
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe<br>
Has been around through thick and thin<br>
And I'd be a fool right now<br>
If I should hurt you girl<br>
And I'd be a fool right now<br>
If I should leave you girl<br>
And I'd be a fool right now<br>
If I wouldn't love you girl<br>
And I'd be a fool right now<br>
On the outside looking inside<br>
They say your love is surely goin'<br>
Just like a snowman in the sun<br>
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe<br>
Was here when all my friends were gone<br>
And I'd be a fool right now<br>
If I should hurt you girl<br>
Oh, such a fool right now<br>
If I should leave you girl<br>
Baby, baby, a fool right now<br>
If I wouldn't love you girl<br>
And I'd be a fool right now<br>
On the outside lookin' inside<br>
All my dreams would fall and crumble into dirt<br>
If I walk away from you I'd be the one to hurt<br>
One day my dreams were surely dying, dying, dying baby<br>
Just like a flower without rain<br>
They just don't know that your sweet sunshine babe<br>
Made my life blossom again<br>
And so the story goes around baby yeah y-yeah<br>
That this is just a passing thing<br>
But I believe in your sweet lovin', lovin'... babe<br>
With every summer fallin' rain<br>
And I'd be a fool right now<br>
If I should hurt you girl<br>
Oh, such a fool right now<br>
If I should leave you girl<br>
I'd be a fool right now<br>
If I wouldn't love you girl<br>
And I'd be a fool right now<br>
Oh, hey!<br>
And I'd be a fool right now<br>
If I should hurt you girl<br>
Oh, such a fool right now<br>
If I should leave you girl<br>

Try to envision you as the oldest living someone<br>
Being every night and day all alone<br>
Going through ages and ages, places and spaces<br>
With never finding that someone to call your own<br>
<br>
Like a treasure chest of dreams long forgotten<br>
Hidden for good in a stolen lost and found<br>
But just when fate was calling quits<br>
Love appeared in the midst of despair, came and turned your life around<br>
I'm new, new like the first day of spring<br>
New like a nightingale that's just learned to sing<br>
I'm new, new like the very start of dawn<br>
Like a child that's first born with your love, I'm new<br>
You're standing amongst a crowd of six billion people<br>
Crying out for help, but no one understands<br>
Cause much to your dismay, you've been taken far away<br>
To a land where joy is pain and sorrow's a happy man<br>
Where an aching heart's the sign of the mighty<br>
And a love-filled heart looks down upon with fault and shame<br>
But at the very instant all was through, lady lucks appears, says "love can do"<br>
And changed you like a Christian who's been born again<br>
<br>
I'm new, new like the fresh morning dew<br>
New like a work of art that's finally through<br>
I'm new, new like a first flight of a dove<br>
So safe and secure with your love, I'm new<br>
<br>
Love took a long time coming to me<br>
But I've gotta say<br>
I owe my thanks to him for sending you my way, hey<br>
<br>
Cause I'm new, new like the first winter snow<br>
Like the start of forever, with infinity to go<br>
I'm new, new like the birth of the sun<br>
Forever young I will be<br>
<br>
Cause with your love, I'm new<br>
New like from a restful night of sleep<br>
New like a starving man that's had food to eat<br>
<br><br>
I'm new, nothing compares nor can compete<br>
Sharing with you the sweetness of your love, I'm new<br>

If it's pleasing...<br>

Like the day that never fails<br>
Like on seashores there are shells<br>
Like the time that always tells<br>
<br>
It holds the key to every heart<br>
Throughout the universe<br>
It fills you up without a bite<br>
And quenches every thirst<br>
<br>
So...<br>
If it's special<br>
Then with it why aren't we as careful<br>
As making sure we dress in style<br>
Posing pictures with a smile<br>
Keeping danger from a child<br>

It holds the key to every heart<br>
Throughout the universe<br>
It fills you up without a bite<br>
And quenches every thirst<br>
<br>
So...<br>
If it's magic...<br>
Why can't we make it everlasting<br>
Like the lifetime of the sun<br>
It will leave no heart undone<br>
For there's enough for everyone<br>

My love is gone with yesterday, my love is gone<br>
with yesterday<br>
<br>
We had a love for all seasons<br>
At least that's how it used to be<br>
There was no time, space, or reason<br>
More special to us than we<br>
<br>
My love continued to flourish<br>
As a flower blooms in spring<br>
Then you tried to play love for silly<br>
But the loser is the fool who doesn't play<br>
love by the rules<br>
<br>
If she breaks your heart<br>
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you<br>
Cause I may not be around to do the things<br>
I used to do<br>
And if you awake to find you're lost<br>
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way<br>
Cause the love I felt inside<br>
Has gone away with yesterday<br>
<br>
My love is gone with yesterday, my love is gone<br>
with yesterday<br>
<br>
There was a time when forever<br>
Was common-place for me and you<br>
Laughing, loving, sharing, caring<br>
Seemed to be made just for us two<br>
But I kept on building the dream world<br>
That I thought was you and I<br>
Sorry, I'm sadly mistaken<br>
Cause our castle in the sky<br>
Has turned into a mere goodbye<br>
<br>
Well if she breaks your heart<br>
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you<br>
Cause I may not be around to do the things<br>
I used to do<br>
And if you awake to find you're lost<br>
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way<br>
Cause the love I felt inside<br>
Has gone away with yesterday<br>

My love is gone away with yesterday, my love is gone<br>

You can't say we shall and not fight through hell<br>
You can't say we will and not dare to deal<br>
You can't shout out peace and then vanish in the crowd<br>
You can't ride the storm without some effect<br>
You can't steal the spoil and not pay the debt<br>
You can't wave a sign that spells "evil" and feel really proud<br>
You can't sing a song with no melody<br>
You can't say we're one without unity<br>
You can't form a line if you're sacred to stand alone<br>
You can't pray for grace and then smack her face<br>
You can't speak of hope and then crack a joke<br>
<br>
You can say you're there but time knows how much you've grown<br>
Put a face to your somebody<br>
<br>
Can you say your name?<br>
Or would you rather stay unknown?<br>
Can you show your face?<br>
Or are you fearful of it shown?<br>
Can you feel your heart?<br>
Or does it beat for you alone?<br>
Lift your glass up high<br>
Say that your truth will never lie<br>
If your love cannot be moved<br>
<br>
You can't look at me and not see yourself<br>
You can't say "for them" and not for who else<br>
You can't truly bless and not bless the good of all<br>
You can't serve the rich and desert the poor<br>
You can't hear their cries and just close the door<br>
You can't say you're down and not take it to the wall<br>
You can't benefit from one's detriment<br>
You can't find the serum and not cure the sick<br>
You can't free the slave to enslave them differently<br>
You can't see the right only from your sight<br>
You can't see the wrong and just go along<br>
Or is that the way you would want your fate to read<br>
Put a face to your somebody<br>
<br>
Can you say your name?<br>
Or would you rather stay unknown?<br>
Can you show your face?<br>
Or are you fearful of it shown?<br>
Can you feel your heart?<br>
Or does it beat for you alone?<br>
Lift your glass up high<br>
Say that your truth will never lie<br>
If your love cannot be moved<br>
<br>
You can't make a pledge and then slip the script<br>
You can't say the words and not move your lips<br>
You can't be confused and still say you understand<br>
You can't be a friend but not through thin and thick<br>
You can't be a click but in danger split<br>
You can't evenly share and then grab the biggest hand<br>
You can't say you do but then show you don't<br>
You can't say you will and make sure you won't<br>
You can't want for change and not do what you need to do<br>
<br>
You can't give up all and then take back all you give<br>
You can't live to die but you can die to live<br>
Or is that too much to ask of the you in you?<br>
Put a face to your somebody<br>
<br>
Can you say your name?<br>
Or would you rather stay unknown?<br>
Can you show your face?<br>
Or are you fearful of it shown?<br>

I hear tell there's big fun tonigh<br>
On the corner of Main and Dog-Meat-Bite<br>
Friday midnights would not be right<br>
Without Redd's hot party and a nasty fight<br>
<br>
But I'll be in your corner<br>
I'll be in your corner, if they do<br>
I'll be in your corner<br>
I'll be in your corner, if they do<br>
<br>
You can't renege cause its goin' be live<br>
Fine women, lots of liquor and stuff for your mind<br>
Now where we're goin' they don't like your kind<br>
But they'll cool when you tell them you're a friend of mine<br>
<br>
'Cause I'll be in your corner<br>
I'll be in your corner, if they do<br>
I'll be in your corner<br>
I'll be in your corner, if they do<br>
<br>
You can't tell your pa and mama<br>
Where we're goin' til after we've been there<br>
'Cause that might make their poor heads worry<br>
And worrying can cause grey hair<br>
And one thing just might lead to another<br>
And if there's any trouble they'll blame it on me<br>
<br>
I think we just might have two to go<br>
The prettys lookin' over here from the middle of the floor<br>
We'll make a b-line to Hotel La Sin<br>
Where you'll do the talkin to get us in<br>
<br>
And I'll be in your corner<br>
I'll be in your corner, if they do<br>
<br>
We shoulda been long gone 'cause this place is hot<br>
'Cause in the corner there are two brothers who are undercover cops<br>
If they stop us for questioning mum is the word<br>
'Cause a question not answered is a answer not heard<br>
<br>
And I'll be in your corner<br>
I'll be in your corner, if they do<br>
I'll be in your corner<br>
I'll be in your corner, if they do<br>
<br>
You can't tell your pa and mama<br>
Where we're goin' til after we've been there<br>
'Cause that might make their poor heads worry<br>
And worrying can cause grey hair<br>
And one thing just might lead to another<br>

Isn't she lovely<br>
Isn't she wonderfull<br>
Isn't she precious<br>
Less than one minute old<br>
I never thought through love we'd be<br>
Making one as lovely as she<br>
But isn't she lovely made from love<br>
<br>
Isn't she pretty<br>
Truly the angel's best<br>
Boy, I'm so happy<br>
We have been heaven blessed<br>
I can't believe what God has done<br>
through us he's given life to one<br>
But isn't she lovely made from love<br>
<br>
Isn't she lovely<br>
Life and love are the same<br>
Life is Aisha<br>
The meaning of her name<br>
Londie, it could have not been done<br>
Without you who conceived the one<br>
That's so very lovely made from love<br>

The wretchedness of Satan's wrath<br>
Will come to seize you at last<br>
'cause even he frowns upon the deeds you are doing<br>
And you know deep in your heart<br>
You've no covenant with God<br>
'cause he would never countenance people abusing<br>
<br>
You know apartheid's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)<br>
Like slavery was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)<br>
Like the holocaust was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)<br>
Apartheid is wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong<br>
It's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)<br>
Wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)<br>
<br>
The pain you cause in God's name<br>
Points only to yourself to blame<br>
For the negative karma you will be receiving<br>
'cause when people are oppressed<br>
With atrocities that test<br>
The future of all mankind we, the world won't stand seeing<br>
<br>
You know apartheid's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)<br>
Like slavery was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)<br>
Like the holocaust was wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)<br>
Apartheid is wrong (Qha), it's wrong (Qha), wrong<br>
It's wrong (Qha), it's wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha), wrong (Qha)<br>

I look inside my crystal ball of desire<br>
And know why rapid beats my heart<br>
I see the spark, I feel the flame of the fire<br>
Letting me know love wants to start<br>
No more playing around<br>
No more waiting around for the special one to come<br>
No more wearing a frown<br>
No more tears coming down 'cause I know what I want<br>
And I want what I know<br>
<br>
Is you<br>
Nobody has to tell me so<br>
It's you, it's you, you're the angel sent from heaven above<br>
It's you, nobody has to tell me so<br>
It's you, you're that angel sent from heaven above for me<br>
(Background-Me for you and you for me)<br>
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one<br>
If only I had not waited my life would be undone<br>
If only I had not waited I woul have picked the wrong one<br>
If only I had not waited for you (Harmonica Solo)<br>
<br>
I look behind and what I sight is the mire<br>
So very lonely was my heart<br>
I look ahead I hear the sound of the choir<br>
Singing that love will never part<br>
No more hearing the sound of the rain coming down<br>
No more I can't see the sun<br>
No more hurting for fun 'cause the moment has come<br>
When I know what I want<br>
And I want what I know<br>
<br>
Is you<br>
Nobody has to tell me so<br>
It's you, you're the angel sent from heaven above<br>
It's you, nobody has to tell me so<br>
It's you, you're that angel sent from heaven above for me<br>

If only I had not waited my life would be undone<br>
If only I had not waited I would have picked the wrong one<br>
If only I had not waited for you<br>
'Cause Baby<br>

It's you<br>
Nobody has to tell me so<br>
It's you, you're the angel sent from heaven above<br>
It's you, nobody has to tell me so<br>

Hey!<br>
<br>
I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone<br>
And I wanna make her love me till the cows come home<br>
And I wanna make her love me till the fire don't burn<br>
And I wanna make her love me till the world cease to turn<br>
<br>
Oh papa, I'm like a little lost lamb<br>
Reaching for a girl that's out of reach<br>
Ah, sit right down and talk to me man to man<br>
Tell me how to practice what you used to preach<br>
Oh, papa used to tell me that a man could do<br>
Anything he ever put his heart into<br>
<br>
But I wanna make her love me till them seas run dry<br>
And I wanna make her love me till money can't buy<br>
I wanna make her love me till the fifth week in May<br>
And I wanna make her love me till Ol' Man River runs away<br>
<br>
Oh, she's a ditty and as pretty as Mona Lisa<br>
Papa's rich and her mama's proud<br>
I worked three jobs tryin' to get what might please her<br>
But still she lives in a world where I ain't allowed<br>
Ah papa, you used to tell me it might take a little sweat<br>
But when a man wakes up he sure enough will get<br>
<br>
I wanna make her love me till the kingdom come<br>
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home<br>
I gonna make her love me till right is wrong<br>
<br>
Ah Hey, yeah Hey<br>
<br>
Ah, I can't compete with Baby Face Pete<br>
And I ain't no match for Lou<br>
He gave her a diamond, a diamond ring the other week<br>
And all I can give her is a heart so true<br>
Oh, papa used to say a true heart will reign<br>
What a true heart desires it sure enough will gain<br>
<br>
But I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone<br>
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home<br>
I gonna make her love me till it snows in June<br>
Hey, hey, save on my baby, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>

She wrecked my life<br>
Cursed my pride<br>
Smashed my dreams<br>
Then threw me aside oh baby yeah<br>
<br>
Holy only blessed me when she put me down<br>
Heaven smiled on me when you I found<br>
You gave this life of mine a bright new chance<br>
Now Beverly's is back to upset our plans<br>
<br>
For each tear that she may cry<br>
It's too late now<br>
(To late now)<br>
For each sweet little lullaby<br>
It's too late now<br>
(Too late now)<br>
<br>
'Cause I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied<br>
And I more than love you girl I idolise you<br>
<br>
She can beg and plead swear up what she needs<br>
But I'll leave you never, I love you forever<br>
<br>
You pick me up from by the wayside<br>
Wiped the dust from my walked on pride<br>
You are the one that patched up all my dreams<br>
Showed me what a true heart really means<br>
<br>
For that baby talk, she talks<br>
It's too late now<br>
(Too late now)<br>
For that wiggly walk she walks<br>
It's too late now<br>
(Too late now)<br>
<br>
'Cause I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied<br>
And I'll never never never leave my baby's side<br>
<br>
With you I remain<br>
She can't break the chains<br>
That binds us together<br>
I'll love you forever<br>
<br>
I love you, I love you, I love you love baby<br>
<br>
Beverly might as well go on her away<br>
Her magic touch faded with yesterday<br>
<br>
You're the sweetest thing under the sun<br>
And now that I found you<br>
I'm sure holding on<br>
<br>
'Cause I love you baby<br>
Really need you baby<br>
Really want you baby<br>
Sure ain't gonna leave you baby<br>
<br>
And I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied<br>
And I more than love you girl I idolise you<br>
<br>
('Cause I'm more than happy, girl, I'm satisfied)<br>
'Cause I love you baby, and I need you baby<br>
(And I never, never, never leave your side)<br>
Ooh, don't go and I love you, sure ain't gonna leave you baby<br>
('Cause I'm more than happy girl, I'm satisfied)<br>
And I more than love you, said I need you baby<br>
(And I more than love you girl, I idolize you)<br>
Ooh, have mercy I love you.<br>

Oh sugar baby I love you so<br>
I need you more than you know<br>
And if I ever had to let you go<br>
I'd sit around I'd break right down<br>

Deep down in my heart<br>
I'd cry<br>
If you leave me tears would start<br>
I'd cry<br>
Everyday that we're apart<br>
I'd cry a river<br>
Don't you leave me ever<br>
<br>
Baby you release in me<br>
Flame of love burns within me<br>
I'd be sad as I can be<br>
If I had to do without you<br>
<br>
I'd cry<br>
If you ever put me down<br>
I'd cry<br>
If you ever play around<br>
I'd cry<br>
It will fall to the ground<br>
I'd fall apart<br>
If you break my heart<br>
<br>
Oh, I love you love you<br>
More than words can say<br>
Love you more and more each day<br>
If you ever ever walk away<br>
I couldn't go on<br>
I'd sit at home<br>
<br>
I'd cry<br>
Like a little bitty babe<br>
I'd cry<br>
If you ever walked away<br>
I'd cry<br>
If you call it a day<br>
I'd cry for years<br>
I'd drown in tears<br>
<br>
I'd cry<br>
If you leave me sad and blue<br>

Ow...<br>
Tossing and turning all night long<br>
My girl is gone, can't take it<br>
I'm trying to conceal the loneliness I feel<br>
But it's real, can't fake it<br>
The pain in my heart is tearing me apart<br>
Her memory, can't shake it<br>
I tried to tell myself to find somebody else<br>
But my heart, won't make it<br>
<br>
Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact<br>
And more than anything I want my baby back<br>
(I want my baby back)<br>
I want her here with me<br>
(I want my baby back)<br>
<br>
(I, want my baby back)<br>
She's the only girl that brightens up my world<br>
What can I say, don't make her do it<br>
She's fine as can be and was so good to me<br>
I had a good thing, and I blew it<br>
Now I'm all alone, the love we had is gone<br>
What can I do, to renew it<br>
If I only had a chance to continue our romance<br>
I wouldn't hestiate, to get to it<br>
<br>
Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact<br>
And more than anything I want my sugar back<br>
(I want my baby back)<br>
I want her here with me<br>
(I want my baby back)<br>
Ah ah ah, ah ah yeah<br>

Ah ah ah, ah ah I need love and that's a natural fact<br>
And more than anything I want my baby back<br>

Ah ah ah, ah ah<br>
Ah ah I, want my baby back<br>
My heart is aching, think it's breaking<br>
Ah ah, ah ah I want my baby back<br>
My world is lonely, need her only<br>
Everybody sing I want my baby back now<br>
(I want my baby back)<br>
Ha ha ha, ha ha I, want my baby back<br>

Playing my harmonica in a mellow way<br>
A teacher seemed to have gathered 'round<br>
Trying to figure out what I was putting down<br>
<br>
I call it pretty music music<br>
But the people call it the blues<br>
<br>
They were looking at me sitting there all alone<br>
Mumbling to each other in a real low tone<br>
I couldn't figure out what they were saying<br>
They couldn't understand what I was playing<br>
<br>
I call it pretty music music<br>
But the people call it the blues<br>

And we'd sing of the joy<br>
Every morning would bring<br>

If I ruled the world<br>
Every man would be<br>
As free as a bird<br>
Every voice would be<br>
A voice to be heard<br>
Take my word<br>
We would treasure each day<br>
That occurred<br>
<br>
My world would be<br>
A beautiful place<br>
Where we would weave<br>
Such a wonderful dream<br>
My world would wear<br>
A smile on its face<br>
<br>
Like the man in the moon<br>
When the moon beams<br>
<br>
If I ruled the world<br>
Every man would say<br>
The world was his friend<br>
There'd be happiness<br>
That no man could end<br>
No my friend<br>
Not if I ruled the world<br>
Every head<br>
Would be held up high<br>
There'd be sunshine<br>
In everyone's sky<br>
If day ever dawned<br>
When I ruled the world<br>

Jimmy was your sweetie pie<br>
Your precious one<br>
And I knew you used to love<br>
The very ground he walked upon<br>
One day, Jim's papa told him<br>
Things were looking down<br>
And they packed up everything<br>
They owned and left this little old town<br>
Each tear I dried for you,<br>
The closer our lives grew,<br>
I fell in love it's true<br>
And you say you love me, too<br>
<br>
Well, don't you know I'm wondering<br>
Little girl, I'm wondering<br>
How can I make you love mev
A little more than you loved him?<br>
Ooh,Baby I'm wondering<br>
Little girl, I'm wondering<br>
How can I make you love me<br>
A little more than you loved him?<br>
Oh baby<br>

How can I make you love me<br>
A little more than you loved him?<br>
Oh baby I'm wondering,<br>
Little girl, I'm wondering<br>
How can I make you love me<br>
A little more than you loved Jim?<br>
<br>
The day you see his face again<br>
Or hear his voice<br>
I don't want to be a loser<br>
If you have to make a choice<br>
Like a puppet to a string<br>
To you, girl, I'm attached<br>
And I know I'd be in trouble<br>
If he came and took you back<br>
I feel so insecure<br>
In my mind, I can picture<br>
Losing you for sure<br>
And the pain I can't endure<br>
<br>
Oh baby I'm wondering<br>
Little girl, I'm wondering<br>
How can I make you love me<br>
A little more than you loved him?<br>
Oh baby I'm wondering,<br>
Sure enough, I'm wondering<br>
How can I make you love me<br>
A little more than you loved Jim?<br>
Ooh Baby<br>
<br>
I can't stop loving you, baby,<br>
I can't stop loving you , no<br>
I can't stop loving you, baby<br>
<br>
I feel so insecure<br>
In my mind, I<br>
Can picture<br>
Losing you for sure<br>
And the pain I can't endure<br>
Baby, I'm worried,<br>
Really, really worried<br>
I wanna make you happy<br>
Really truly happy<br>
<br>
Oh baby I'm wondering,<br>
Little girl, I'm wondering<br>
How can I make you love me<br>
A little more than you loved him?<br>
Oh baby I'm wondering<br>
Little girl, I'm wondering ...<br>

Butterflies begin<br>
From having been another<br>
As a child is born<br>
From being in a mother's womb<br>
But how many times have you<br>
wished you were some other<br>
someone than who you are<br>
<br>
Yet who's to say<br>
If all were uncovered<br>
You will like what you see<br>
You can only be you<br>
As I can only be me<br>
<br>
Flowers cannot bloom<br>
Until it is their season<br>
As we would not be here<br>
unless it was our destiny<br>
But how many times have you<br>
wished to be in spaces<br>
Time places than what you were<br>
Yet who's to say with unfamiliar<br>
faces You could anymore be<br>
Loving you that you see<br>
You can only be you<br>
As I can only be<br>
Me<br>
<br>
I can only be me<br>
