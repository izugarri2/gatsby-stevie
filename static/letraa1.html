Like a long lonely stream<br>
I keep runnin' towards a dream<br>
Movin' on, movin' on<br>
Like a branch on a tree<br>
I keep reachin' to be free<br>
Movin' on, movin' on<br>
'Cause there's a place in the sun<br>
Where there's hope for ev'ryone<br>
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run<br>
There's a place in the sun<br>
And before my life is done<br>
Got to find me a place in the sun<br>
Like an old dusty road<br>
I get weary from the load<br>
Movin' on, movin' on<br>
Like this tired troubled earth<br>
I've been rollin' since my birth<br>
Movin' on, movin' on<br>
There's a place in the sun<br>
Where there's hope for ev'ryone<br>
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run<br>
There's a place in the sun<br>
And before my life is done<br>
Got to find me a place in the sun<br>
You know when times are bad<br>
And you're feeling sad<br>
I want you to always remember<br>
Yes, there's a place in the sun<br>
Where there's hope for ev'ryone<br>
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run<br>
There's a place in the sun<br>
Where there's hope for ev'ryone<br>
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run<br>
There's a place in the sun<br>
Where there's hope for ev'ryone...<br>

We're a people black as is your night<br>
Born to spread Amma's eternal light<br>
Which since time began<br>
Has been to bring truth to every man<br>
<br>
Our ancestors have since long ago<br>
Passed their wisdom down so we to know<br>
For here lies the key<br>
That will help unfold the mistery<br>
<br>
A seed's a star<br>
A seed's a star's a seed<br>
A star's a seed<br>
A star's a seed's a star<br>
<br>
In myself I do contain<br>
The elements of sun and rain<br>
First a seed with roots that swell<br>
I gradually burst through my shell<br>
Pushing down into the ground<br>
The root of me is homeward bound<br>
A trunk, a leaf and there I am<br>
A miracle of least by far<br>
<br>
Tree - you are the longest living one we know<br>
the largest of all plants and still you grow<br>
<br>
Tree - within your branches there's such history<br>
so much of what we're searching for to know<br>
<br>
Every fifty years we celebrate<br>
Po Tolo, our star, as it rotates<br>
Though infinitely small<br>
It is still the heaviest of them all<br>
<br>
(Background)<br>
<br>
A seed's a star<br>
A seed's a star's a seed<br>
A star's a seed<br>
A star's a seed's a star<br>
A seed's a star<br>
A seed's a star's a seed<br>
A star's a seed<br>
A star's a seed's a star<br>

Ye Lolo De Ye<br>
Lolo Ye Kesse De Ye<br>
Kesse ye lolo De Ye<br>
Lolo Ye Kesse De Ye<br>
Kesse ye lolo De Ye<br>
Lolo Ye Kesse De Ye<br>
Kesse ye lolo De Ye<br>
Lolo Ye Kesse De Ye<br>
<br>
And some believe antennas are their leaves<br>
That spans beyond our galaxy<br>
They've been, they are and probably will be<br>
Who are the mediocrity<br>

There is a garden<br>
Where every heart can<br>
Share in the joy of giving<br>

It like no other<br>
Has love to cover<br>
Bearing no price on living<br>

Quietty listen and you might hear them singing their lullaby<br>
Calling for you to join in their love filled garden<br>

All is fair in love<br>
Love's a crazy game<br>
Two people vow to stay<br>
In love as one they say<br>
But all is changed with time<br>
The future none can see<br>
The road you leave behind<br>
Ahead lies mystery<br>
But all is fair in love<br>
I had to go away<br>
A writer takes his pen<br>
To write the words again<br>
That all in love is fair<br>
<br>
All of fate's a chance<br>
It's either good or bad<br>
I tossed my coin to say<br>
In love with me you'd stay<br>
But all in war is so cold<br>
You either win or lose<br>
When all is put away<br>
The losing side I'll play<br>
But all is fair in love<br>
I should have never left your side<br>
A writer takes his pen<br>
To write the words again<br>
That all in love is fair<br>
<br>
A writer takes his pen<br>
To write the words again<br>
That all in love is fair<br>

Angel baby don't you ever leave me<br>
<br>
Girl you're my sunshine<br>
You make me smile when skies are grey<br>
But I'll never, never smile again<br>
If somebody take my sunshine away<br>
So I'm gonna work and toil, sweat and strain<br>
Try to give you everything<br>
<br>
So no rich man, poor man begger man thief<br>
Could ever steal you away from me<br>
<br>
My little angel baby<br>
Don't you spread your wings<br>
Angel baby don't you ever leave me<br>
<br>
Angel baby Don't you spread your wings<br>
Angel baby don't you ever leave me<br>
<br>
'Cause I love ya and I need ya<br>
And I want you for myself<br>
I couldn't make it baby<br>
If you leave me for somebody else<br>
<br>
My little angel baby<br>
Don't you spread your wings<br>
Angel baby don't you never ever leave me<br>
<br>
Angel baby Don't you spread your wings<br>
Angel baby don't you ever leave me.<br>

Ain't that asking for troublee<br>
Now ain't that asking for trouble<br>
<br>
Baby you remind me of a pretty rose<br>
That's awfully painful to my touch<br>
And though there's thorns underneath the rose<br>
Baby you hurt twice as much<br>
<br>
You made me cry a thousand times, ha<br>
And leaving me with a broken heart<br>
I should stand many miles away<br>
But I'm right here in your arms<br>
<br>
Now ain't that asking for trouble<br>
<br>
Baby the way I'm at your beck and call<br>
I must be hypnotised<br>
'Cause I, I know I've got sense enough to know<br>
That loving you ain't wise<br>
<br>
Sure as the sun may shine<br>
My heart will be in pain<br>
Like a child that's seen papa<br>
I'm in your arms again<br>
<br>
Now ain't that asking for trouble<br>
<br>
Baby I, I can't stop my loving you<br>
Until you hurt me so much<br>
My plans not to see you again<br>
Baby but your tender touch<br>
I guess I'm just too weak for you<br>
I shoulda been so long gone<br>
But here I'm in your arms again<br>
And I'm still holding on<br>
<br>
Now ain't that asking for trouble.<br>

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving<br>
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May<br>
Just as hate knows love's the cure<br>
You can rest your mind assure<br>
That I'll be loving you always<br>
<br>
As now can't reveal the mistery of tomorrow<br>
But in passing will grow older every day<br>
Just as all is born is new<br>
Do you know what I say is true<br>
That I'll be loving you always<br>
<br>
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky<br>
ALWAYS<br>
Until the ocean covers every mountain high<br>
ALWAYS<br>
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea<br>
ALWAYS<br>
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream<br>
<br>
Did you know that true love asks for nothing<br>
Her acceptance is the way we pay<br>
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee<br>
To last through forever and another day<br>
<br>
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning<br>
And the seasons know exactly when to change<br>
Just as kindness knows no shame<br>
Know through all your joy and pain<br>
That I'll be loving you always<br>
<br>
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow<br>
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear<br>
For I'll know deep in my mind<br>
The love of me I've left behind<br>
Cause I'll be loving you always<br>
<br>
Until the day is night and night becomes the day<br>
ALWAYS<br>
Until the trees and sea just up and fly away<br>
ALWAYS<br>
Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4<br>
ALWAYS<br>
Until the day that is the day that are no more<br>
Did you know you're loved by somebody?<br>
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left<br>
ALWAYSv
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself<br>
I'll loving you forever<br>
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through<br>
ALWAYS<br>
Until the day that you are me and I am you<br>
AL~~~~WA~~~~~~~AA~~~~~~~AA~~~<br>
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky<br>
~~~~~~~~AA~~~~~~~AA~~~~~~~~AA~~~<br>
Until the ocean covers every mountain high<br>
~~~AA~~~~~~~~AA~~~~~~~~YS<br>
<br>
We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles<br>
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space<br>
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double<br>
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed<br>
So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it<br>
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell<br>
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love<br>
And maybe our children's grandchildren<br>
And their great-great grandchildren will tell<br>
<br>
I'll be loving you<br>
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky<br>
Loving you<br>
Until the ocean covers every mountain high<br>
Loving you<br>
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea<br>
Loving you<br>
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream<br>
Be loving you<br>
Until the day is night and night becomes the day<br>
Loving you<br>
Until the trees and seas up, up and fly away<br>
Loving you<br>
Until the day that 8x8x8x8 is 4<br>
Loving you<br>
Until the day that is the day that are no more<br>
Loving you<br>
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left<br>
Be loving you<br>
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself<br>
Loving you<br>
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through<br>
Loving you<br>
Until the day that you are me and I am you<br>
Now ain't that loving you<br>
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky<br>
Ain't that loving you<br>
Until the ocean covers every mountain high<br>
And I've got to say always<br>
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea<br>
AL~~~~~~~~WA~~~~~~~~~~~AYS<br>
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream<br>

Close your eyes 'til the morning<br>
Close your eyes 'til the early dew<br>
Get inside what you've been missing<br>
Are the very first words that I heard coming from you<br>
<br>
Take a chance on the secret<br>
That you hide for beneath your dreams<br>
Use your wildest imagination<br>
You just tell me what it is and I will make it be<br>
<br>
As if you read my mind<br>
As if you touched my soul<br>
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go<br>
<br>
Let's get high on the happy<br>
With a toast to you and me<br>
Love is here just for the giving<br>
And between us we've got all the love we'll ever need<br>
<br>
As if you read my mind<br>
As if you touched my soul<br>
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go<br>

 A Time To Love<a name="A10">.</a>

We have time for racism<br>
We have time for criticism<br>
Held bondage by our ism's<br>
When will there be a time to love<br>
<br>
We make time to debate religion<br>
Passing bills and building prisons<br>
For building fortunes and passing judgements<br>
When will there be a time to love<br>
<br>
At this point in history we have a choice to make<br>
To either walk a path of love<br>
Or be crippled by our hate<br>
<br>
We have time to cause pollution<br>
We have time to cause confusion<br>
All wrapped up in our own illusions<br>
When will there be a time to love<br>
<br>
We make time to conquer nations<br>
Time for oil exploration<br>
Hatred, violence and terrorism<br>
When will there be a time to love<br>
<br>
At this moment in time<br>
We have a choice to make<br>
Father God is watching<br>
While we cause mother earth so much pain<br>
It's such a shame<br>
<br>
Not enough money for<br>
The young, the old and the poor<br>
But for war there is always more<br>
When will there be a time to love<br>
<br>
We make time for paying taxes<br>
Or paying bills and buying status<br>
But we will pay the consequences<br>
If we don't make the time to love<br>
<br>
Now's the time to pay attention<br>
Yes now is the time~~~ to love~~~~~~~<br>
A time love~~~~~ Love~~~~<br>
A time to Love<br>
Please, please won't you tell me<br>
When will there be a time to love~~~~<br>
<br>
Will there be a time to love<br>
When Will there be<br>
When Will there be a time to love<br>
When Will there be<br>
When Will there be a time to love~~~~~~<br>
When Will there be<br>
When Will there be a time to love~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Please won't you tell me<br>
When will there be a time to love~~~~~~<br>

I was drifting from day to day<br>
<br>
Like a child that's lost his way<br>
in a great big world<br>
<br>
Then a miracle happened by<br>
when you happened into my life<br>
and said you love me<br>
<br>
All around me the world was cold<br>
then you tenderly touched my soul<br>
with your sunshine girl<br>
<br>
And my future you gave it birth<br>
and my living you gave it worth<br>
little Angie<br>
<br>
Cause I love you, Angle girl<br>
I love you, yes, I do<br>
heaven knows my heart is true,oh ho ho<br>
<br>
When I'm feelin' my faith is gone<br>
You're my reason for going on<br>
through another day<br>
<br>
Cause the tender times that we share<br><br>
truly show me that you care<br>
about me<br>
<br>
Whenever life makes you cry<br>
just remember I'm standing by<br>
to lead the way<br>
<br>
And together we'll never fall<br>
together we'll conquer all<br>
little Angie<br>
<br>
Cause I love you, Angle girl<br>
I love you, yes, I do<br>
heaven knows my heart is true<br>

There's a warm little home on a hill<br>
And the presents are hiding somewhere<br>
And the world is so peaceful and still<br>
You can almost hear love in the air<br>
<br>
There's a blanket of snow on the ground<br>
And a bright little star in the sky<br>
And your heart knows that Santa is near<br>
By the twinkle in everyone's eye<br>
<br>
There's gift bringing and bells ringing<br>
And warm little feet by the fire<br>
There are kids playing and folks praying<br>
And somewhere the sound of a choir<br>
<br>
There's two people that never will part<br>
And two stockings we still have to fill<br>
There's a warm little place in my heart<br>
For our warm little home on the hill<br>
