                          But all we do is constantly dog one another<br>
                          We are supposed to act as each other's cover<br>
                          But we keep at each other's throat<br>
                          Each other's throat<br>
                          Each other's throat<br>
                          Yo, it ain't no joke<br>
                          We're at each other's throat -Aowl, Aowl<br>
                          We are supposed to spread love and not evil<br>
                          But we've been acting more like heathens than people<br>
                          Treating our fellow-man far worse than illegal<br>
                          Cause we keep at each other's throat<br>
                          Each other's throat<br>
                          Each other's throat<br>
                          Yo, it ain't no joke<br>
                          We're at each other's throat -Aowl, Aowl<br>
                          Ut oh, 11 o'clock pm and here's the news<br>
                          Another fatality caused by a family feud<br>
                          Charged, tried, sentenced by the jury of a brother's gun<br>
                          Made sister's fiancee's wedding never to be sung<br>
                          He didn't like the way he treated the girl<br>
                          So the boy played God, pow, he ended his world<br>
                          He made a plea for temporary insanity<br>
                          But left his sister insane permanently<br>
                          This ain't new, this stuff happens everyday<br>
                          Somebody doesn't like someone so they blow them away<br>
                          Too fast for reason, too quick to negotiate<br>
                          Regret and sorrow happens a split second too late<br>
                          Jealousy for power, greed for possession<br>
                          Selfishness so you give someone a faked out impression<br>
                          Speaking of which I'm truly not impressed<br>
                          So if seeing is believin'-I don't wanna see the mess<br>
                          Heartless are we on the straight with no chaser<br>
                          As if for negativity we got the vapors<br>
                          Know as I love me so I do love my neighbor<br>
                          Cause we are too busy at each other's throat<br>
                          Each other's throat<br>
                          Each other's throat<br>
                          Yo, it ain't no joke<br>
                          We're at each other's throat -Aowl, Aowl<br>

                          Yes, forever is how long my love will stay<br>
                          Forever is a long, long time<br>

                      <div align="left"><font color="#CCFFFF" size="3"> I am a veteran of the war<br>
                          I up and joined the army back in 1964<br>
                          At sixteen I just had to be a man at any cost<br>
                          I volunteered for Vietnam where I got my leg shot off<br>
                          I recall a quote from a movie that said "'s more a man<br>
                          Than a man with a reason that's worth dyin'for"<br>
                          <br>
                          They had me standing on the front line<br>
                          They had me standing on the front line<br>
                          They had me standing on the front line<br>
                          But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead<br>
                          <br>
                          They gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill<br>
                          To stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill<br>
                          They put a gun in my hand and said, "shoot until he's dead"<br>
                          But it's hard to kill when 'please your friend' echoes through your head<br>
                          <br>
                          Brought up in church taught no man should take another's life<br>
                          But then put in a jungle where life has no price<br>
                          <br>
                          They had me standing on the front line<br>
                          They had me standing on the front line<br>
                          They had me standing on the front line<br>

                          At least, that's the way the story goes<br>
                          Frankie bought everything for Johnny<br>
                          From his sports-car to his Ivy League clothes<br>
                          Oh, he was a man allright,<br>
                          Oh, but he was doing a-wrong<br>
                          Just to show you what came happen<br>
                          <br>
                          A friend came running to Frankie<br>
                          Said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie<br>
                          I saw your man riding in his Jaguar<br>
                          With a chick named Mary Bley<br>
                          Oh if he was your man honey<br>
                          Let me tell you he was doing you wrong<br>
                          Let me tell the story<br>
                          <br>
                          Frankie ran around the corner<br>
                          And peeked in a swinging place<br>
                          And there she saw Johnny with a woman<br>
                          He had his arm around her waist<br>
                          Oh he was a man alright<br>
                          But Frankie could see that he was doing a-wrong<br>
                          Oh let me tell you<br>
                          <br>
                          Frankie reached down in her pocketbook<br>
                          And up with a long 44<br>
                          She shot once, twice, three times<br>
                          And Johnny fell on the hardwood floor<br>
                          Oh he was a man alright<br>
                          But she shot him because he was doing a-wrong<br>
                          But the last thing he told her was<br>
                          <br>
                          Frankie, you know I love you<br>

                          Frankie, I was telling her about you<br>
                          Frankie, you know I love you<br>
                          Frankie, you know that I love you<br>
                          Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
                          <br>

                          Frankie I'll always love you baby<br>
                          Frankie, you know I can't do without you<br>
                          Frankie, you know I love you<br>
                          I'm your man and I know I was doing a-wrong <br>

                          Is then when He'll stop to hear our song<br>

                          Has the good in man expired<br>
                          Stealing all the love and the beauty from the land<br>
                          <br>
                          Yes we are feeding off the love of the land<br>
                          Never hearing what He's saying<br>
                          <br>
                          Living off the love of the Lord<br>
                          Never feeling what you're praying<br>
                          <br>
                          Never praising Him for beauty<br>
                          Only praying God please give me<br>
                          <br>
                          Stealing all the love and the beauty from the land<br>

                      <div align="left"><font color="#CCFFFF" size="3"> Out of the blue there came to me a question<br>
                          The kind that ‘til you answer won’t let you be<br>
                          The question was if I was blessed with the gift of sight<br>
                          What most in life would I want to see<br>
                          That made me think of an old story<br>
                          About a boy who had no control of his feet or hands<br>
                          Who was asked if he could walk and touch again what would he do<br>
                          And he said as I understand<br>
                          If mine eyes were to see<br>
                          Let them be the witness of a world that is color free<br>
                          And if my limbs were to move<br>
                          Let them touch and walk this land when hate can no longer be<br>
                          And if my ears were to hear<br>
                          Let it like the sweetest music be unity and harmony<br>
                          And should my mouth start to speak<br>
                          Let me talk about a land when love’s for all<br>
                          And fear can’t put dreams to sleep<br>
                          Ay ay ay<br>
                          Hey<br>
                          Sad if you don’t use your eyes<br>
                          Your hands and feet at any time<br>
                          When called upon to lift up someone’s life<br>
                          Sad if you refuse to hear<br>
                          Or speak to make the pathway clear<br>
                          Then someday you will pay the debter’s price<br>
                          And if mine eyes were to see<br>
                          Let them be the witness of a world that is color free<br>
                          And if my limbs were to move<br>
                          Let them touch and walk this land when hate can no longer be<br>

                          Take me right away<br>
                          <br>
                          A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow<br>
                          Into a lovely smile that's blooming<br>
                          And it's so clear to me that your my dream come true<br>
                          There is no way that I'll be losing<br>
                          <br>
                          Golden lady, golden lady<br>

                          Cause there's too many things to view<br>
                          And when eyes begin to wander<br>
                          They more than likely never get through<br>
                          But beyond my own temptation<br>
                          I'm enticed by what I see<br>
                          And I won't feel satisfaction<br>

                          You are a sight for sore eyes to see<br>

                          Come on girl, make you my reality<br>
                          <br>
                          Never been too much for talking<br>
                          Cause there's too many things to say<br>
                          And by the time that I start speaking<br>
                          The right moment has slipped away<br>
                          But I must break this old tradition<br>
                          And try to muster up the words<br>
                          And though someone else may have said them<br>
                          I'll say them in way you've never heard<br>
                          <br>

                          I've gotta make you my reality<br>
                          I gotta have you, I gotta have you<br>
                          I gotta have you for me<br>

                          Cause there's too many things to feel<br>
                          Plus there's too much disappointment<br>
                          When you find out those feelings ain't real<br>
                          But here's a time when inner senses<br>
                          Are gonna have to shine the light<br>
                          Cause I have overly committed<br>
                          Myself in thinking that you're alright<br>
