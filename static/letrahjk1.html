All my life I was alone,<br>
Didn't think I'd find my part,<br>
Now I see there's joy inside your arms.<br>

Every day I searched for the star,<br>
That never was in the sky,<br>
And now I see this star is on earth.<br>

And I'm happier than the morning sun<br>
And that's the way you said that I would be -that's<br>

If I gave you a chance to come inside my life.<br>

You know it doesn't make much sense<br>
There ought to be a law against<br>
Anyone who takes offense<br>
At a day in your celebration<br>
'Cause we all know in our minds<br>
That there ought to be a time<br>
That we can set aside<br>
To show just how much we love you<br>
And I'm sure you would agree<br>
It couldn't fit more perfectly<br>
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday<br>
<br>
I just never understood<br>
How a man who died for good<br>
Could not have a day that would<br>
Be set aside for his recognition<br>
Because it should never be<br>
Just because some cannot see<br>
The dream as clear as he<br>
that they should make it become an illusion<br>
And we all know everything<br>
That he stood for time will bring<br>
For in peace our hearts will sing<br>
Thanks to Martin Luther King<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday<br>
<br>
Why has there never been a holiday<br>
Where peace is celebrated<br>
all throughout the world<br>
<br>
The time is overdue<br>
For people like me and you<br>
Who know the way to truth<br>
Is love and unity to all God's children<br>
It should never be a great event<br>
And the whole day should be spent<br>
In full remembrance<br>
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people<br>
So let us all begin<br>
We know that love can win<br>
Let it out don't hold it in<br>
Sing it loud as you can<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday to you<br>
Happy birthday<br>
<br>
Happy birthday<br>
Happy birthday<br>
Happy birthday<br>
Ooh yeah<br>
Happy birthday...<br>
We know the key to unify all people<br>
Is in the dream that you had so long ago<br>
That lives in all of the hearts of people<br>
That believe in unity<br>
We'll make the dream become a reality<br>
I know we will<br>
Because our hearts tell us so<br>

There are people who have let the problems of today<br>
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way<br>
But every problem has an answer and if your's you cannot find<br>
You should talk it over to Him<br>
He'll give you peace of mind<br>
When you feel your life's too hard<br>
Just go have a talk with God<br>
<br>
Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend<br>
Never communicating with the One who lives within<br>
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down<br>
And you can talk to him anytime He's always around<br>
When you feel your life's too hard<br>
Just go have a talk with God<br>
<br>
Well He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world<br>
For solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls<br>
When you feel your life's too hard<br>
Just go have a talk with God<br>

You'd have more than one place to go oh<br>

His only concern is how much you'll pay<br>
He's Misstra Know-It-All<br>
<br>
If he shakes<br>
On a bet<br>
He's the kind of dude that won't pay his debt<br>
He's Misstra Know-It-All<br>
<br>
When you say that he's livin wrong<br>
He'll tell you he knows he's livin' right<br>
And you'd be a stronger man<br>
If you took Misstra Know-lt-All's advice oh oh<br>
<br>
oou... oou... oou oou... oou...<br>
<br>
He's the man<br>
With a plan<br>

<br>
Dum bum bum ba bum bum,<br>
Dum bum bum ba bum bum<br>
Bum bum bum bum bum Say<br>
He's Misstra Know-It-All<br>
<br>
Can this line<br>
Take his hand<br>
Take your hat off to the man who's got the plan<br>
He's Misstra Know-It-All<br>
<br>
Every boy take your hand<br>
To the man that's got the plan<br>
He's Misstra Know-It-All<br>
<br>
Give a hand to the man<br>
That you know he's got the plan<br>
He's Misstra Know-It-All<br>

Give a hand to the man<br>
You know damn well he's got the super plan<br>

If we had less of him<br>
Don't you know we'd have a better land<br>
He's Misstra Know-It-All<br>
<br>
So give a hand to the man<br>
Although you've given out as much as you can<br>

They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away<br>
And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday<br>
They say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away<br>
But if there is a God, we need Him now<br>
"Where is your God"<br>
That's what my friends ask me<br>
And I say it's taken Him so long<br>
'Cause we've got so far to come...<br>
<br>
Tell me people<br>
Why can't they say that hate is 10 zillion light years away<br>
Why can't the light of good shine God's love in every soul<br>
Why must my color black make me a lesser man<br>
I thought this world was made for every man<br>
He loves us all, that's what my God tells me<br>
And I say it's taken Him so long<br>
'Cause we've got so far to come...<br>
<br>
But in my heart I can feel it, yeah,<br>
Feel His spirit wow oh woo...<br>
Feel it, yeah, feel His spirit...<br>
<br>
I... can't say that heaven is 10 zillion light years away<br>
But if so let all be pure at heart<br>
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray<br>
Let God's love shine within to save our evil souls<br>
For those who don't believe will never see the light<br>
"Where is my God" - He lives inside of me<br>
And I say it's taken Him so long<br>
'Cause we've got so far to come...<br>
No people, "where is your God?"<br>
Inside please let Him be<br>
And I say it's taken Him so long<br>
'Cause we've got so far to come...<br>
<br>
But if you open your heart you can feel it yeah yeah<br>
Feel His spirit, yeah<br>
Feel it, feel His spirit, wow oh wow...<br>
Feel it, you can feel His spirit<br>
I opened my heart one morning and<br>
I sho nuff could feel it yeah yeah<br>
Feel His spirit yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit<br>
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit<br>

Hello young lovers who ever you are<br>
I hope your troubles are few<br>
All my good wishes go with you tonight<br>
I've been in love like you<br>

Be brave young lovers and follow your star<br>
Be brave and faithful and true<br>
You got to cling to each other and very close tonight<br>
I've been in love like you<br>

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels<br>
And fly down the street in a trance<br>
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet<br>
And you meet not really by chance<br>
<br>
Don't cry young lovers what ever you do<br>
Don't cry because I'm alone<br>
<br>
All of my memories are happy tonight<br>
I've had a love of my own<br>
<br>
I've had a love of my own like yours<br>
I've had a love of my own<br>

There was a girl I used to know<br>
She was oh so beautiful<br>
But she's not here anymore<br>
She had a college degree<br>
Smart as anyone could be<br>
She had so much to live for<br>
But she fell in love<br>
With the wrong kinda man<br>
He abused her love and treated her so bad<br>
There was not enough education in her world<br>
That could save the life of this little girl<br>
<br>
How come, how long<br>
It's not right, it's so wrong<br>
Do we let it just go on<br>
Turn our backs and carry on<br>
Wake up, for it's too late<br>
Right now, we can't wait<br>
She won't have a second try<br>
Open up your hearts<br>
As well as your eyes<br>
<br>
She tried to give a cry for help<br>
She even blamed things on herself<br>
But no one came to her aid<br>
Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell<br>
That's what we'd like to tell ourselves<br>
But no, it wasn't that way<br>
So she fell in love<br>
With the wrong kinda man<br>
And she paid with her life<br>
For loving that man<br>
So we cannot ignore,<br>
We must look for the signs<br>
And maybe next time we might save<br>
Somebody's life<br>
<br>
How come, how long<br>
It's not right, it's so wrong<br>
Do we let it just go on<br>
Turn our backs and carry on<br>
Wake up, for it's too late<br>
Right now, we can't wait<br>
She won't have a second try<br>
Open up your hearts<br>
As well as your eyes<br>
<br>
I on occasion met that guy<br>
It's been a feeling deep inside<br>
Some ... wasn't right<br>
The way he proves himself a man<br>
By beating his woman with his hands<br>
Oh I wish that she'd seen the light<br>
How can someone like that call himself a man<br>
He's not a man<br>
Soon reality ...<br>
And we cannot ignore<br>
Whenever we see the signs<br>
'Cause any kind of abuse<br>
God knows, it's a crime<br>
<br>
How come, how long<br>
It's not right, it's so wrong<br>
Do we let it just go on<br>
Turn our backs and carry on<br>
Wake up, for it's too late<br>
Right now, we can't wait<br>
She won't have a second try<br>
Open up your hearts<br>
As well as your eyes<br>

In life we have our pains and sorrows<br>
Face mountains we think we can't climb<br>
Not thinking there's always tomorrow<br>
You feel like giving up,<br>
You say you're out of luck<br>
But then you hear a voice in your mind<br>
Telling you to<br>
<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
Cause they're always worth having<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
Like a father to his son<br>
Don't let anyone ever<br>
steal your joy from you<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
'till the day your life is said and done<br>
<br>
This world is filled peaks and valleys<br>
With rivers we think we can't cross<br>
To busy keeping sorrows telling<br>
You say you're at you're end<br>
You say you never win<br>
But then a light comes on in your mind<br>
Telling you<br>
<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
Cause they're always worth having<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
Like a father to his son<br>
Don't let anyone ever<br>
steal your joy from you<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
Until the day your life is said and done<br>

If you wanna hold on to something<br>
You better hold on to your dreams<br>
If you want to hold on to something<br>
You've gotta hold to your love<br>
Hold on to your love<br>
<br>
So if they try to burst your bubble<br>
It's 'cause they have none of their own<br>
And when you feel you are in trouble<br>
Hold your head up high and<br>
feel your heart inside<br>
And know that you are never alone<br>
Just as long as you<br>
<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
Cause they're always worth having<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
Like a mother to her child<br>
Don't let anyone ever steal<br>
your dreams from you<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
And do your best to always wear a smile<br>
<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
Cause they're always worth having<br>
Hold on to your dream<br>
Like a father to his child<br>
Don't let anyone ever<br>

I've always come to the conclusion that 'but' is the way<br>
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head<br>
So I have tried to not be the one who 'll fall into that line<br>
But what I feel inside I think you should know<br>
<br>
And baby that's you - you - you<br>
Made life's his*to*ry<br>
Caue you've brought some joy inside my tears<br>
And you have done what no one thought could be<br>
You've brought some joy inside my tears<br>
<br>
I've alwys felt that tomorroqw is for those who are too much afraid<br>
To go past yesterday and start for today<br>
I feel that lasting moments are coming fr and few between<br>
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring<br>
Baby, baby it's you - you - you<br>
Made life's his*to*ry<br>
Oh baby, you've brought some joy inside my tears<br>
Baby you have done what no one thought could be<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
<br>
You've brought some joy inside my tears<br>
Baby, baby you have done what no one thought could be<br>
He - y, you brought some joy inside my tears<br>
Gotta tell you<br>
You - you - you made life's his*to*ry<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
- you brought you brought you brought some joy inside my tears<br>
Baby baby baby you have done what no one thought could be<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
<br>
You made it baby you made it baby made it made life's his*to*ry<br>
- you you you made life's his*to*ry<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
You have done what no one thought could be<br>
- No-body ever thought it would be<br>
You have done what no one thought could be<br>
<br>
You you you made life's his*to*ry<br>
- Gotta shout about it baby<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
<br>
You have done what no one thought could be<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
You you you made life's his*to*ry<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
You brought some joy inside my tears<br>
You brought some joy inside my<br>

I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever<br>
We've got jungle fever, we're in love<br>
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy<br>
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love<br>
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love<br>

She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy<br>
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love<br>
<br>
She can't love me, I can't love her<br>
Cause they say we're the wrong color<br>
Staring, gloating, laughing, looking<br>
Like we've done something wrong<br>
Because we show love strong, get real, come on<br>
Calling us names too bad to mention<br>
But we pay them no attention<br>
For color blind are inner feelings<br>
If we feel happiness<br>
And know our love's the best, forget their mess<br>
<br>
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever<br>
We've got jungle fever, we're in love<br>
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy<br>

She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever<br>
We've got jungle fever, we're in love<br>
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy<br>
We're each other's baby, we're in love<br>
<br>
Everyone's created equal<br>
Hell with all you ignorant people<br>
Trying to stereo type us<br>
You really ought to quit<br>
Cause you don't know jack, you make us sick<br>
Get off my jock, you're trying to ride me<br>
Because I got my girl beside me<br>
You'll only make yourself look stupid<br>
I love you're trying to dis<br>
Cause we've got happiness, I bet you're pissed<br>
<br>
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever<br>
We've got jungle fever, we're in love<br>
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy<br>
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love<br>
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever<br>
We've got jungle fever, we're in love<br>

I see us in the park<br>
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head<br>
And words from our hearts<br>
Told only to the wind felt even without being said<br>
I don't want to bore you with my trouble<br>
But there's sumptin' bout your love<br>
That makes me weak and<br>
Knocks me off my feet<br>
<br>
There's supmtin' bout your love<br>
That makes me weak and<br>
Knocks me off my feet<br>
Knocks me off my feet<br>
<br>
I don't want to bore you with it<br>
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you<br>
I don't want to bore you with it<br>
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you<br>
More and more<br>
<br>
We lay beneath the stars<br>
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind<br>
I reach out for the part<br>
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find<br>
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble<br>
But there's sumptin' bout your love<br>
That makes me weak and<br>
Knocks me off my feet<br>
<br>
There's sumptin' bout your love<br>
That makes me weak and<br>
Knocks me off my feet<br>
Knocks me off my feet<br>
<br>
3*(I don't want to bore you with it<br>
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you)<br>
Darling I don't...<br>

Give me a chance to catch my breath<br>
Cause I'm in a state of awe<br>
Guess miracles do never cease<br>
For we're back together now<br>
<br>
Pardon me please if I pinch myself<br>
So to know this is not a dream<br>
As I reminisce the love e shared<br>
And the pain there was between<br>
<br>
Look at the clouds in the sky<br>
They seem so happy now<br>
Look at the sun, feel it's rays<br>
With such a smiling face<br>
Maybe we can't but maybe we can<br>
With the love that we're feeling inside<br>
Share it with all the world and see each heart<br>
Kiss lonely good-bye<br>
<br>
If given a chance to live again<br>
I'd change not a single thing<br>
Cause that little chance could sadly mean<br>
That you to me faith wouldn't bring<br>
<br>
Partly I cry for those linely nights<br>
And a heartache I thought couldn't end<br>
Yet joyfully I cry cause I know our love<br>
We won't let us lose again, never again<br>
<br>
Look at the clouds in the sky<br>
They seem so happy now<br>
Look at the sun, feel it's rays<br>
With such a smiling face<br>
Maybe we can't but maybe we can<br>
With the love that we're feeling inside<br>
Share it with all the world and see each heart<br>

Keep Our Love Alive<a name="K20">.</a>

Feeble is the mind that says they don't care<br>
Selfish is the heart that won't give their share<br>
Poor them, Poor we<br>
<br>
Wasted is the mind that won't take a stand<br>
Lieth the tongue that says they can't when they can<br>
Poor him, Poor she<br>
<br>
For as long as we live,<br>
And are blessed with air on earth to breathe<br>
We all should live to keep our love alive<br>
<br>
More than blinds the soul that sees but won't show<br>
Lost the leader with the way but won't go<br>
For you, For me<br>
<br>
Worthless is the one with will but won't try<br>
Grounded are we all if we don't think high<br>
Of you, You of me<br>
<br>
For as long as we live,<br>
And are blessed with air on earth to breathe<br>
We all should live to keep our love alive<br>
<br>
Let's keep our love alive<br>
<br>
For as long as I live,<br>
And am blessed with air on earth to breathe<br>
I know I'll live to keep our love alive.<br>
