It's hard to forget a mother, and if as in the case of Lula, it gave everything for their children. He was born on January 11, 1930 on a sharecropper farm in Alabama, and had a difficult youth, which survived poorly with episodes of abuse, forced prostitution and the need to steal to be able to feed their children. The bad fortune was primed in she once more time with the "visual disability" of his third son <font color="#00FFFF"> Stevland Judkins</font> (Stevie Wonder), whose problem was blamed, although the excess oxygen in the incubator where they had to treat him to be born prematurely was the cause.<br>

              She relates in her biography, with his son Stevie at the piano, a piece of melody, a piece of letter, over and over again: "<font color="#99FFCC"><i>Here I am baby.... Here I am baby." and that she was "Signed, sealed, and delivered. I'm yours</i></font>". <br>
