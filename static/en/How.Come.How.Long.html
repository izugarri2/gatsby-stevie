The times are changing ..., that is repeated again and again over the last decades chorus. But however modern and evolved to believe it is making this society, there are attitudes and situations that contradict this belief and it leads us to a primitive and savage age.  <br><br>
<font color="#00FFFF">Wars, racism, hatred, intolerance, or abuse</font> again and again beat us and they stick like glue to our daily existence.

It is in our power to change that anomaly of the human being, correcting it through an education from very early ages. But we can also use the music, In addition to being a form of communication of feelings and moods, it is also a way of denouncing unjust and perverse situations. <br><br>

<font color="#00FFFF">Stevie Wonder</font>, along with <font color="#00FFFF">Babyface</font>, used this method to denounce gender violence that repeatedly runs mainly against women in the third world, and too in the "idyllic" richest and most advanced societies.

This complaint in form of song is <font color="#00FFFF">How Come, How Long</font>. Composed and performed by them, is a duet at the end of the decade of the 90's. Based on the true story of Nicole Brown Simpson, tells the sad story of abuse to a woman who was finally killed by her partner. <br><br>
A song that, despite trying something so crude and disgusting, is full of beauty and loveliness. The song was nominated for the best pop collaboration song in the Grammys awards, and the video can see an acoustic version of the song denouncing and imploring to society more solidarity and fairer. In our hands it is to put that bit to get it.

There was a girl I used to know<br />
  She was oh so beautiful<br />
  But she's not here anymore<br />
  She had a college degree<br />
  Smart as anyone could be<br />
  She had so much to live for<br />
  But she fell in love<br />
  With the wrong kinda man<br />
  He abused her love and treated her so bad<br />
  There was not enough education in her world<br />
  That could save the life of this little girl<br><br />
  How come, how long<br />
It's not right, it's so wrong<br />
Do we let it just go on<br />
Turn our backs and carry on<br />
Wake up, for it's too late<br />
Right now, we can't wait<br />
She won't have a second try<br />
Open up your hearts<br />
As well as your eyes<br><br />
She tried to give a cry for help<br />
She even blamed things on herself<br />
But no one came to her aid<br />
Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell<br />
That's what we'd like to tell ourselves<br />
But no, it wasn't that way<br />
So she fell in love<br />
With the wrong kinda man<br />
And she paid with her life<br />
For loving that man<br />
So we cannot ignore<br />
We must look for the signs<br />
And maybe next time<br />
We might save somebody's life<br><br />
How come, how long<br />
It's not right, it's so wrong<br />
Do we let it just go on<br />
Turn our backs and carry on<br />
Wake up, for it's too late<br />
Right now, we can't wait<br />
She won't have a second try<br />
Open up your hearts<br />
As well as your eyes<br /><br>
I on occasion met that guy<br />
He stirred up bad feelings deep inside<br />
Something about him wasn't right<br />
The way he proves himself a man<br />
By beatin' his woman with his hands<br />
Oh I wish she'd seen the light<br />
How can someone like that<br />
Call himself a man<br />
In reality he's far more less than that<br />
And we cannot ignore<br />
Whenever we see the signs<br />
'cause any kinda of abuse<br />
God knows isn't right<br><br />
How come, how long<br />
It's not right, it's so wrong<br />
Do we let it just go on<br />
Turn our backs and carry on<br />
Wake up, for it's too late<br />
Right now, we can't wait<br />
She won't have a second try<br />
Open up your hearts<br />
As well as your eyes</div>
