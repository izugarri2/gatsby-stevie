            <div class="grid_12" style="padding-bottom:30px;"> "<font color="#FFFF00">Fear Can't Put Dreams To Sleep</font>" is how could it be otherwise, another
              song written by Stevie showing their concerns and wishes for ourselves to keep alive the flame for a world free and without hate. Published around
              1991, there have been several times when it has been interpreted. With Take 6 at the Democratic convention with Obama in 2008, and early 90's in this
              video. </div>

              <div style="background-color: #17284B; height: 290px; overflow: auto; width: auto;" align="center"> From out of the blue there came to me a question<br>
                the kind that until you answer won’t let you be<br>
                The question was if I was blessed<br>
                w/the gift of sight<br>
                what most in life would I want to see<br>
                That made me think of an old story<br>
                about a boy who had no feet …<br>
                no feet or hands who was asked if he could walk what would he do<br>
                And he said, as I understand,<br>
                Chorus: If my eyes were to see<br>
                let them be the witness of a world that is color free<br>
                And if my limbs were to move<br>
                let me touch and walk in land where hate could no longer be<br>
                And if my ears were to hear<br>
                let it be like sweetest music be in sync with harmony<br>
                And if my mouth were to speak,<br>
                let me talk about a land were love’s for all<br>
                and fear can’t put dreams to sleep<br>
                And in a crowd there came two sisters<br>
                one talking to the other one in sign<br>
                and she asked of the sister of all things if you could hear<br>
                what would you like to hear most at this time<br>
                She, without any hesitation,<br>
                gave the tale of girl that<br>
                could talk what would you say<br>
                and she wasn’t seeing at all<br>
                Repeat Chorus: If my eyes were to see<br>
                let them be the witness of a world that is color free<br>
                And if my limbs were to move<br>
                let me touch and walk in land where hate could no longer be<br>
                And if my ears were to hear let it like the sweetest music be in unity and harmony And if my mouth were to speak, let me talk about a land were
                love’s for all and fear can’t put dreams to sleep Repeat Chorus: If my eyes were to see let them be the witness of a world that is color free And if
                my limbs were to move let me touch and walk in land where hate could no longer be And if my ears were to hear let it like the sweetest music be in
                unity and harmony And if my mouth were to speak, let me talk about a land were love’s for all and fear can’t put dreams to sleep Repeat Chorus: If

                could no longer be And if my ears were to hear let it like the sweetest music be in unity and harmony And if my mouth were to speak, let me talk
