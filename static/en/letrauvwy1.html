Though you don't call anymore<br>
I sit and wait in vain<br>
I guess I'll rap on your door<br>
Tap on your window pane<br>
I want to tell you Baby<br>
The changes I've been going through<br>
Missing you.<br>
Listen you<br>
<br>
'till you come back to me<br>
That's what I';m gonna do<br>
<br>
Why did you have to decide<br>
You had to set me free<br>
'm gonna swallow my pride<br>
I'm gonna beg you to (please<br>
baby please) see me<br>
I'm gonna walk by meself<br>
Just to prove that my love is true<br>
Oh, for you baby<br>
<br>
'till you come back to me<br>
That's what I'm gonna do<br>

Baby, ev'rything is all right, uptight, out of sight.<br>
Baby, ev'rything is all right, uptight, out of sight.<br>
<br>
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks,<br>
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back,<br>
But I'm the envy of ev'ry single guy<br>
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye.<br>
When we go out stepping on the town for a while<br>
My money's low and my suit's out of style,<br>
<br>
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new<br>
Out of sight because my heart is true.<br>
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, out of sight.<br>
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.<br>
<br>
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say,<br>
I guess her folks brought her up that way,<br>
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised<br>
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids.<br>
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy,<br>
<br>
No football hero or smooth Don Juan,<br>
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son.<br>
She says give her the things that money can buy<br>
But I'll never, never make my baby cry,<br>
<br>
And it's all right, what I can't do,<br>
Out of sight because my heart is true,<br>
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.<br>
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.<br>
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, ah ah ah ah,<br>
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.<br>
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.<br>

Morning side<br>
System's gone from me<br>
After love debris's still with me<br>
Not doin' all right<br>
<br>
Apetite<br>
I can't even think<br>
No sign of relief is...<br>
Not doin' all right<br>
<br>
'Cause I've got an upset stomach<br>
From a broken heart<br>
A tear stained pillow<br>
From my crying eyes<br>
A migraine headache<br>
That just won't go away<br>
Because I think our love has fallen apart<br>
<br>
Sunny skies<br>
Are cloudy to me<br>
Black sad as can be confusing<br>
We're not doin' all right<br>
<br>
Happy smile<br>
Has turned in reverse<br>
Before work I must rehearse you<br>
Not doin' all right<br>
<br>
'Cause I've got an upset stomach<br>
From a broken heart<br>
A tear stained pillow<br>
From my crying eyes<br>
A migraine headache<br>
That just won't go away<br>
Yes I've got an upset stomach<br>
From a broken heart<br>
A tear stained pillow<br>
From my cryin' eyes<br>
A migraine headache<br>
That just won't go away<br>
Because I think our love has fallen apart<br>
<br>
It's really hard<br>
You said go away<br>
(Repeat five times)<br>
<br>
Be free<br>
Free me<br>
Alone<br>
Leave me free me<br>
Leave me alone<br>
Won't you leave me alone<br>
<br>
I'm a soul<br>
Of the broken kind<br>
All feelings so fine have left me<br>
Not doin' all right<br>
<br>
Only love<br>
Of the healing kind<br>
And what's down time can help me<br>
Back up to doin' all right<br>
<br>
'Cause I've got an upset stomach<br>
From a broken heart<br>
A tear stained pillow<br>
From my crying eyes<br>
A migraine headache<br>
That just won't go away<br>
Because I think our love has fallen apart<br>
<br>
It's fallen apart<br>
Our love has fallen apart<br>
<br>
Yes I've got an upset stomach<br>
From a broken heart<br>
A tear stained pillow<br>
From my cryin' eyes<br>
A migraine headache<br>
That just won't go away<br>
Because I think our love has fallen apart.<br>

Hello flower<br>
Boy, do you look juicy<br>
And you know just what I’m coming to get, right<br>

Would you like to go with me<br>
Down my dead end street<br>
Would you like to come with me<br>
To Village Ghetto Land<br>
<br>
See the people lock their doors<br>
While robbers laugh and steal<br>
Beggars watch and eat their meals-from garbage cans<br>
<br>
Broken glass is everywhere<br>
It's a bloody scene<br>
Killing plagues the citizens<br>
Unless they own police<br>
<br>
Children play with rusted cars<br>
Sores cover their hands<br>
Politicians laugh and drink-drunk to all demands<br>
<br>
Families buying dog food now<br>
Starvation roams the streets<br>
Babies die before they're born<br>
Infected by the grief<br>
<br>
Now some folks say that we should be<br>
Glad for what we have<br>
Tell me would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land<br>

People hand in hand<br>
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land?<br>
Where hates a dream and love forever stands<br>
Or is this a vision in my mind?<br>
<br>
The law was never passed<br>
But somehow all men feel they're truly free at last.<br>
Have we really gone this far through space and time<br>
Or is this a vision in my mind?<br>
<br>
I'm not one who make believes<br>
I know that leaves are green<br>
They only turn to brown when autumn comes around<br>
I know just what I say<br>
Today's not yesterday<br>
And all things have an ending<br>
<br>
But what I'd like to know<br>
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful<br>
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away<br>
To the vision in our mind?<br>

Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone<br>
We can work it out<br>
We can work it out<br>

Think of what you're saying<br>
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright<br>
Think of what I'm saying<br>
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night<br>
We can work it out<br>
We can work it out<br>
<br>
Life is very short, and there's no time<br>
For fussing and fighting, my friend<br>
I have always thought that it's a crime<br>
So I will ask you once again.<br>
Try to see it my way<br>
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong<br>
While you see it your way<br>
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long<br>

Everytime I think our love is drifting apart<br>
Something always throws it back together<br>
And everytime I think I've found someone new for my heart<br>
After one kiss my heart tells me never<br>
<br>
Oh everyone has got a weakness in life<br>
Girl, you just happen to be mine<br>
Oh everyone has got a certain weakness in life<br>
Your love just happens to be mine<br>
<br>
Everytime I think your love has no more to give<br>
You do something more to take me higher<br>
And everytime I think that for someone else I could live<br>
I'd be living love out as a liar<br>
<br>
Oh everyone has got a weakness in life<br>
Girl, you just happen to be mine<br>
Oh everyone has got a certain weakness in life<br>
Your love just happens to be mine<br>
<br>
We keep thinking that our love won't last beyond tomorrow<br>
But our hearts say we're gonna stay in love this way<br>
<br>
Oh everyone has got a weakness in life<br>
Girl, you just happen to be mine<br>
Oh everyone has got a certain weakness in life<br>
Your love just happens to be mine<br>

Where is the missing one, the missing one<br>
Where is the missing one, the missing one<br>
There is a missing person that I’ve just got to find<br>
Now just how long they have been gone<br>
I can’t say at this time<br>
I glanced outside my window surprisingly to see<br>
The reflection of a broken man who looked somewhat like me<br>
I’m trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do<br>
When nothing seems to follow through<br>
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I’m turning blue<br>
But wait I may have found a clue<br>
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you<br>
Where is the missing one, the missing one<br>
I looked inside an album of happy photographs<br>
To try to match the feeling<br>
In the joy I used to have<br>
I travelled through the moments that held a special place<br>
But everytime what came to mind is that smile upon your face<br>
<br>
I’m trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do<br>
When nothing seems to follow through<br>
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I’m turning blue<br>
But wait I may have found a clue<br>
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you<br>
<br>
Where is the missing one, the missing one<br>
<br>
I’m trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do<br>
When nothing seems to follow through<br>
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I’m turning blue<br>
But wait I may have found a clue<br>
My whereabouts are somewhere lost in yesterday with you<br>
I’m trying to find my whereabouts, what can I do<br>
When nothing seems to follow through<br>
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I’m turning blue<br>

Honey, sweet<br>
I've got something to say to you in privacy<br>
Something I'd like for you to hear<br>
And only your ears alone<br>
<br>
Secretly<br>
I've been admiring you intensely<br>
So much so I'd like to settle down with you<br>
And make a home<br>
<br>
You are my first breath<br>
My first smile<br>
And my morning cup of tea<br>
Yours is the love<br>
That I pray for<br>
Before I go to sleep<br>
<br>
From the time I saw your face<br>
I knew no other could erase<br>
My loving you with each beat of my heart<br>
<br>
Until the day I heard your speak<br>
I didn't know that sound was sweet<br>
Me hearing you with each beat of my heart<br>
<br>
There's a time when playing ends<br>
And the serious begins<br>
Like the love that I felt from the start<br>
With each beat of my heart<br>
<br>
Honey, sweet<br>
I soared into a heaven's galaxy<br>
So hypnotized was I<br>
From seeing all the magic in your eyes<br>
<br>
So I bring<br>
To you what's been a lifetime fantasy<br>
O f being with the only one who can<br>
Create my paradise<br>
<br>
You are my first breath<br>
My first smile<br>
And my morning cup of tea<br>
Yours is the love<br>
That I pray for<br>
Before I go to sleep<br>
<br>
From the time I saw your face<br>
I knew no other could erase<br>
My loving you with each beat of my heart<br>

Until the day I heard your speak<br>
I didn't know that sound was sweet<br>

No request is too extreme<br>

Fate is kind<br>
She brings to those to love<br>
The sweet fulfillment of<br>
Their secret longing<br>

Like a bolt out of the blue<br>
Fate steps in and sees you through<br>

Though I know that we meet ev'ry night<br>
And we couldn't have change since the last time,<br>
To my joy and delight,<br>
It's a new kind of love at first sight.<br>
Though it's you and it's I all the time<br>
Ev'ry meeting's marvelous pastime.<br>
You're increasingly sweet,<br>
So whenever we happened to met<br>
I greet you ...<br>
<br>
With a song in my heart<br>
I behold your adorable face.<br>
Just a song at the start<br>
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.<br>
When the music swells<br>
I'm touching you hand<br>
It tells that your're standing near, and ..<br>
At the sound of your voice<br>
Heaven opens his portals to me.<br>
Can I help but rejoice<br>
That a song such as ours came to be?<br>
But I always knew<br>
I would live life through<br>
With a song in my heart for you.<br>
<br>
Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night<br>
And these stars will not twinkle and fade out,<br>
And the words in my ears<br>
Will resound for the rest of my years.<br>
In the morning I find with delight<br>
Not a note of our music is played out.<br>
It will be just as sweet,<br>
And an air that I'll live to repeat:<br>
I greet you ...<br>
<br>
With a song in my heart<br>
I behold your adorable face.<br>
Just a song at the start<br>
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.<br>
When the music swells<br>
I'm touching you hand<br>
It tells that your're standing near, and ..<br>
At the sound of your voice<br>
Heaven opens his portals to me.<br>
Can I help but rejoice<br>
That a song such as ours came to be?<br>
But I always knew<br>
I would live life through<br>
With a song in my heart for you.<br>

Without a song, the day would never end<br>
Without a song, the road would never have been<br>
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend<br>
Without a song<br>
<br>
That field of corn, would never see a plow<br>
That field of corn, would be deserted now<br>
A man is born, but he's no good no how<br>
Without a song<br>
<br>
I've got my trouble and woe, but sure as I know<br>
The Jordan will roll<br>
I'll get along, as long as a song<br>
Is strung in my soul<br>
<br>
I'll never know, what makes the rain to fall<br>
I'll never know, what makes the grass grow tall<br>
I only know, there ain't no love at all<br>
Without a song.<br>

What happened to the world we knew<br>
When we would dream and scheme<br>
And while the time away<br>
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday<br>
Where did it go that yester glow<br>
When we could feel<br>
The wheel of life turn our way<br>
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday<br>
I had a dream so did you life<br>
Was warm and love was true<br>
Two kids who followed all the rules<br>
Yester folls and now<br>
Now it seems those yester dreams<br>
Were just a cruel<br>
And foolish game we used to play<br>
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday<br>
When I recall what we had<br>
I feel lost I feel sad with nothing but<br>
The memory of yester love and now<br>
Now it seems those yester dreams<br>
Were just a cruel<br>
And foolish game we had to play<br>
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday<br>
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday<br>
Sing with me<br>
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday<br>

Here we are on earth together,<br>
It's you and I,<br>
God has made us fall in love, it's true,<br>
I've really found someone like you,<br>
<br>
Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say,<br>
That you will be by my side<br>
To see me through,<br>
Until my life is through,<br>
<br>
Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world,<br>
In love you and I, you and I, you and I,<br>
<br>
I am glad at least in my life I found someone<br>
That may not be here forever to see me through,<br>
But I found strength in you,<br>
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day,<br>
Because that's all that I am living for, you see,<br>
Don't worry what happens to me.<br>
<br>
Cause' in my mind, you will stay here always,<br>
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I<br>
In my mind we can conquer the world<br>
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I.<br>

I feel like this is the beginning,<br>
Though I've loved you for a million years,<br>
And if I thought our love was ending,<br>
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears.<br>

You are the sunshine of my life,<br>
That's why I'll always stay around,<br>
You are the apple of my eye,<br>
Forever you'll stay in my heart,<br>

You must have known that I was lonely,<br>
Because you came to my rescue,<br>
And I know that this must be heaven,<br>
How could so much love be inside of you?<br>

Hey there miss fine<br>
Sweet little clinging vine<br>
Your actions kind of show me you love me truly, yeah<br>
You're warmer than July, sweet as apple pie<br>
I can't let you know you're getting to me<br>
<br>
Yeah, ‘cause you can't judge a book by it's cover<br>
My papa used to say “look child, look beyond a tender smile<br>
‘Cause can't judge a book by it's lover”<br>
<br>
Girl, I'm sweet on you<br>
Though you can't see through this unconcerned expression I've been wearing<br>
Hey, I practice looking bored so you can feel ignored<br>
But that don't mean that I'm not really caring<br>
Yeah, ‘cause you can't judge a book by it's cover<br>
And you can't judge a book by it's lover”<br>
Maybe my coldness is a mask, maybe your loving will last<br>
But can't judge a book by it's cover<br>
<br>
Somewhere beyond the skin, somewhere deep within<br>
We may find that love is there to test us, yeah<br>
But we've got to have the nerve to give it all it deserves<br>
And maybe we'll find something precious<br>
Yeah, ‘cause you can't judge a book by it's cover<br>
Only time it's gonna show, only time will let us know<br>
‘Cause you can't judge a book by it's cover<br>
And you can't judge a book by it's lover<br>
We've got to search each other's minds<br>
We've got to read between the lines<br>
Oh, take a different look<br>
And make our hearts an open book<br>
Oh, you can't judge a book by it's cover<br>
No, no, no, no<br>
And you can't judge a book by it's lover<br>

We are amazed but not amused<br>
By all the things you say that you'll do<br>
Though much concerned but not involved<br>
With decisions that are made by you<br>
<br>
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song<br>
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong<br>
'Cause if you really want to hear our views<br>
"You haven't done nothing"!<br>
<br>
It's not too cool to be ridiculed<br>
But you brought this upon yourself<br>
The world is tired of pacifiers<br>
We want the truth and nothing else<br>
<br>
And we are sick and tired of hearing your song<br>
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong<br>
'Cause if you really want to hear our views<br>
"You haven't done nothing"!<br>

Doo doo wop - hey hey hey<br>

Doo doo wop - bum bum bum<br>
Doo doo wop<br>
<br>
We would not care to wake up to the nightmare<br>
That's becoming real life<br>
But when mislead who knows a person's mind<br>
Can turn as cold as ice un hum<br>
<br>
Why do you keep on making us hear your song<br>
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong<br>
'Cause if you really want to hear our views<br>
"You haven't done nothing"!<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
Jackson 5 sing along again say<br>
Doo doo wop<br>
Doo doo wop - oh<br>

Sing it loud for your people say<br>

You met you your match<br>
When you play with my affection<br>
You met you your match<br>
When you tried to make me walk the line<br>
When you decided you would hurt me<br>
That's when your grape feel off the vine<br>

Your mama told me that I better be mellow<br>
She said you're just a baby maybe too green<br>
I told her Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and Victor<br>

Mama shake off that dream<br>
I told her that you were really cooking<br>
My love is burning for a turn at the steam<br>

Lonely one of young so brokenhearted<br>
Travelling down the rigid road of life<br>
Using pharmaceutical extractions<br>
To find the paradise<br>
<br>
Finds the high but comes down feeling lower<br>
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray<br>
Looking up to heaven for the answer<br>
They hear a voice that says<br>
<br>
You will know<br>
Troubled heart you'll know<br>
Problems have solutions<br>
Trust and I will show<br>
<br>
You will know<br>
Troubled heart you'll know<br>
Every life has reason<br>
For I made it so<br>
<br>
Single parent trying to raise their children<br>
But they would much rather not alone<br>
Reaches out to find that special someone<br>
To make their house a home<br>
<br>
Finds someone but no one is the right one<br>
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray<br>
Looking up to heaven for the answer<br>
They hear a voice that says<br>
<br>
You will know<br>
Troubled heart you'll know<br>
Problems have solutions<br>
Trust and I will show<br>
<br>
You will know<br>
Troubled heart you'll know<br>
Every life has reason<br>

You've Got It Bad Girl<a name="Y20">.</a>

When you believe in a feeling,<br>
And it's holding you back from my love,<br>
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl.<br>
<br>
When you insist on excluding<br>
The tenderness that's in my kiss,<br>
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl.<br>
<br>
If you try to display an emotion,<br>
That will contradict itself,<br>
You will find your heart just sitting<br>
Like a statue on a shelf, on a shelf, on a shelf.<br>
<br>
Should you depend on an outlet,<br>
Through which an escape can be found,<br>
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl.<br>
<br>
If you don't see there's no way out,<br>
Just no way of getting around me,<br>
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl.<br>
<br>
Yes, you know the plans I am making,<br>
Are intended to capture you,<br>
So you practice false reactions,<br>
To delay the things I do, the things I do,<br>
things I do, foolish you.<br>
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad.<br>
<br>
There's no reward in detouring<br>
My deep sincerity.<br>
Especially since what you're feeling,<br>
Is perfectly clear to me, clear to me, clear to me.<br>
<br>
Before you discover the feeling,<br>
You've tried very hard to hide,<br>
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl.<br>
<br>
But when you can find just a small space,<br>
To let my love live in your mind,<br>
Then you'll have it good girl, you'll have it good girl.<br>
