Are you telling me you feel<br>
Like you have never felt<br>
Ut Oh, my heart<br>
Don't you know those famous words<br>
Be seen but not heard<br>
Taboo to love<br>
<br>
Are you telling me your eyes<br>
Met hers to your surprise<br>
But why, my heart?<br>
How loud must you hear me say<br>
Have fun but don't play<br>
Taboo to love<br>
<br>
Where's your lantern or candlelight<br>
So to guide you through hidden spaces<br>
Though its said truth unveils all lies<br>
Feelings can't be left to roam<br>
<br>
So you say you've lost your head<br>
But you use your heart instead<br>
Beware of love<br>
This is not like you at all<br>
Who vowed to never fall<br>
Taboo to love, taboo to love<br>
Taboo (background)<br>
To love, taboo to love<br>
Taboo (background)<br>
<br>
Where's your raincoat and over-boots<br>
To protect you in stormy weather<br>
Though its said when you walk in truth<br>
Love can bring you no harm<br>
<br>
So you've made up in your mind<br>
You'll leave your fears behind<br>
So brave my heart<br>
I guess your heart has made you see<br>
Its better to be free<br>
No taboo to love<br>
<br>
I guess your heart has made you see<br>
Its much better to be free<br>
No Taboo to love<br>
No taboo to love<br>
Taboo (Background)<br>
To love, no taboo to love<br>
Taboo (Background)<br>
To love, no taboo to love<br>
Taboo (Background)<br>
To love, no taboo to love<br>
Taboo (Background)<br>
No taboo to love<br>

Lying out on the street, there's a man<br>
That needs somewhere to sleep<br>
And a bag-lady digs, through the trash<br>
Hoping to find some food to eat<br>
In the cold winter's snow, walks a boy<br>
That needs shoes for his feet<br>
In an old run-down house, there's a child<br>
In a crib that needs some heat<br>
In the dark of the night, a young man<br>
Searches for a guiding light<br>
And a young woman cries in despair<br>
Cause she feels alone in life<br>
You might ask yourself what in the hell<br>
Does that have to do with me<br>
Well, here is your wake up call...<br>
"Everything!"<br>
Cause we all play a part in each other's existence<br>
<br>
Take the time out to love someone<br>
Reach your arms out and hug someone<br>
Be it king or some homeless one<br>
We are all one underneath the sun<br>
<br>
Take the time out to be right there<br>
Take the time out to show you care<br>
You'll be so glad when the day is done<br>
You took the time out to love someone<br>
<br>
There's a man in a house where they're selling crack<br>
Yet he's trying to be strong<br>
But when lost in the sea, of no hope<br>
He must be saved from wrong<br>
Don't say what you won't do, if for days<br>
You had no food to eat<br>
Nor extremes you won't go, for a bed, shoes<br>
Or if your baby needed heat<br>
You do not have the right to pre-judge<br>
<br>
If you don't share your strength<br>
<br>
And you can't say you're down for the fight<br>
If you won't go the length<br>
Now I don't really care what you feel<br>
If you don't feel for life<br>
And don't care what you think if your words<br>
Don't have ways and actions that perpetuate life<br>
<br>
Take the time out to love someone<br>
Reach your arms out and hug someone<br>
Be it king or some homeless one<br>
We are all one underneath the sun<br>
<br>
Take the time out to be right there<br>
Take the time out to show you care<br>
You'll be so glad when the day is done<br>
You took the time out to love someone<br>
(Repeat)<br>
<br>
I think it's time to...<br>
<br>
Take the time out to love someone<br>
Reach your arms out and hug someone<br>
Be it king or some homeless one<br>
We are all one underneath the sun<br>
<br>
Take the time out to be right there<br>
Take the time out to show you care<br>
You'll be so glad when the day is done<br>
You took the time out to love someone<br>

When life reaches out and takes you<br>
On an unpleasent ride<br>
And your bridge of dreams comes<br>
Tumblin' down<br>
Don't let your bed of sorrow<br>
Ever conquer your pride<br>
Remember there's always a way out<br>
<br>
Just take up a course in happiness<br>
Take up a course to clear out your mind<br>
You will show yourself how to smile<br>
Take up a course in happiness<br>
Take up a free instruction in life<br>
You will learn how to smile<br>
<br>
And when your optimism<br>
Has a set back or two<br>
And you feel all your tryin's in vain<br>
(Your heart's in the rain)<br>
Don't give up the hope that's due you<br>
Just to study your doubt<br>
Remember there's always a way out<br>

Take up a course to clear out your mind<br>

Did you say I've got a lot to learn?<br>
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn<br>
Since this is the perfect spot to learn<br>
Teach me tonight<br>
<br>
Starting with the ABC of it<br>
Right down to the XYZ of it<br>
Help me solve the mystery of it<br>
Teach me tonight<br>
<br>
The sky's a blackboard high above you<br>
If a shooting star goes by<br>
I'll use that star to write "I love you"<br>
1000 times across the sky<br>
<br>
One thing isn't very clear, my love<br>
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?<br>
Graduation's almost here, my love<br>
Teach me tonight<br>

You lift me to the sky<br>
When I'm flat on the ground<br>
You put me on a high<br>
When I'm all the way down<br>
And when trouble comes around<br>
Trying to blow up the spot<br>
You look it in the eye and say "I think not"<br>
<br>
Tell your heart I love you<br>
I love you, yes I do<br>
Tell your heart I need you<br>
You need to know its true<br>
Don't nobody in the world love you like I do<br>
<br>
You make me feel like a trillion bucks<br>
When I don't even have a dime<br>
You put a smile on my face<br>
In a time I could be crying<br>
And when negative comes around<br>
With nothing good to say<br>
You give it a stare that makes it get the hell away<br>
<br>
Tell your heart I love you<br>
I love you, yes I do<br>
Tell your heart I need you<br>
You need to know its true<br>
Don't nobody in the world love you like I do<br>
<br>
Long before my mind believed<br>
My heart could not help but conceive<br>
That I love you, yeah<br>
And when my heart did suggest<br>
My heart had already confessed<br>
That I love you, love you, love you<br>
<br>
Tell your heart I love you<br>
I love you, yes I do<br>
Tell your heart I need you<br>
You need to know its true<br>
Don't nobody in the world love you like I do<br>

That soon shell have my mind<br>
That girl thinks that shes so smart<br>
That soon shell have my heart<br>
She thinks in no time flat<br>
That shell be free and clear to start<br>
With her emotional rescue of love that youll leave turn apart<br>
<br>
That girl thinks that shes so bad<br>
Shell change my tears from joy to sad<br>
She says she keeps the upper hand<br>
cause she can please her man<br>
She doesnt use her love to make him weak<br>
She uses love to keep him strong<br>
And inside me theres no room for doubt<br>
That it wont be too long<br>
<br>
Before I tell her that I love her<br>
That I want her<br>
That my mind, soul and body needs her<br>
Tell her that Id love to, that I want to<br>
That I need to do all that I have to<br>
To be in her love<br>
<br>
Ive been hurting for a long time<br>
And youve been playing for a long time<br>
You know its true<br>
Ive been holding for a long time<br>
And youve been running for a long time<br>
Its time to do what we have to do<br>
That girl, that girl<br>
<br>
That girl knows every single man<br>
Would ask her for her hand<br>
But she says her love is much too deep<br>
For them to understand<br>
She says her love has been crying out<br>
But her lover hasnt heard<br>
But what she doesnt realize is that Ive listened to every word<br>
<br>
Thats why I know Ill tell that I love her<br>
That I want her<br>
That my mind, soul and body needs her<br>
Tell her that Id love to, that I want to<br>
That I need to do all that I have to<br>
To be in her love<br>
<br>
Tell her I love her<br>
That I want her<br>

Tell her that Id love to, that I want to<br>
That I need to do all that I have to<br>
To be in her love<br>

That I love her<br>
That I want her<br>

Tell her that Id love to, that I want to<br>
That I need to do all that I have to...<br>

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire<br>
Jack frost nipping at your nose<br>
<br>
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir<br>
and folks dressed up like Eskimos<br>
<br>
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe<br>
Help to make the season bright<br>
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow<br>
Will find it hard sleeping tonight<br>
<br>
They know that Santa's on his way<br>
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh<br>
and ev'ry Mother's child is gonnna spy<br>
To see if reindeer really know how to fly<br>
<br>
And so I'm offering this simple phrase<br>
To kids from one to ninety-two<br>
Although it's been said many times, many ways<br>
Merry Christmas to you<br>

once upon a christmas eve<br>
a shepherd who believed<br>
that peace could come to any man<br>
made a promise to the star above<br>
the day that love began<br>
<br>
i will give to him my lamb<br>
a shepherds all i am<br>
and so he walked the lonely sand<br>
to find the place his heart was dreaming of<br>
the day that love began<br>
<br>
over meadows over mountains<br>
they came from valleys and from streams<br>
every poet and every king<br>
and one little shepherd with a dream<br>
<br>
but as the shepherd knelt to pray<br>
his lamb just ran away<br>
and tear drops filled his empty hand<br>
he broke his promise to the star above<br>
the day that love began<br>
<br>
then the smiling face of mary<br>
beckoned the shepherd to her side<br>
today you gave him the best gift of all<br>
the moment that you cried<br>
<br>
once upon a christmas eve<br>
a shepherd who believed<br>
that peace could come to any man<br>
found the place his heart was dreaming of<br>

We find inside the Secret Life of Plants<br>

A species smaller than the eye can see<br>
Or larger than most living things<br>
And yet we take from it without consent<br>
Our shelter, food, habilment<br>
<br>
But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being<br>
For these are but a few discoveries<br>
Wwe find inside the Secret Life of Plants<br>

But far too many give them in return<br>
A stomp, cut, drown, or burn<br>
As is they're nothing<br>
But if you ask yourself where would you be<br>
Without them you will find you would not<br>

And some believe antennas are their leaves<br>
That spans beyond our galaxy<br>

When was the last time<br>
That they heard you say<br>
Mother or father, I love you<br>
And when was the last time<br>
That they heard you say<br>
Daughter or son, I love you<br>
<br>
Ones you say you cherish everyday<br>
Can instantly be taken away<br>
Then you'd say I know this can't be true<br>
When you never took the time<br>
To simply tell them "I love you"<br>
<br>
When was the last time<br>
That they heard you say<br>
Sister or brother, I love you<br>
And when was the last time<br>
That they heard you say<br>
Darling or best friend, I love you<br>
<br>
The one for whom you'd give your very life<br>
Could be taken in the twinkling of an eye<br>
Through your tears you'd ask why did you go<br>
Knowing you'd didn't always show<br>
Just how much you loved them so<br>
<br>
These three words<br>
Sweet and simple<br>
These three words<br>
Short and kind<br>
These three words<br>
Always kindles<br>
An aching heart to smile inside<br>
<br>
I know a family<br>
Who hasn't a cent to their name<br>
And yet the joy and love they have between them<br>
They always claim<br>
And when one's called from life<br>
The survived mourn the lost<br>
And will never be the same<br>
Yet they rejoice<br>
In knowing they gave them their all<br>
<br>
These three words<br>
Sweet and simple<br>
These three words<br>
Short and kind<br>
These three words<br>
Always kindles<br>

No more lying friends<br>
Wanting tragic ends<br>
Though they do pretend<br>
They won't go when I go<br>
All those bleeding hearts<br>
With sorrows to impart<br>
Were right here from the start<br>
And they won't go when I go<br>
And I'll go where I've longed<br>
To go so long<br>
Away from tears<br>
Gone from painful cries<br>
Away from saddened eyes<br>
Along with him I'll bide<br>
Because they won't go when I go<br>
Big men feeling small<br>
Weak ones standing tall<br>
I will watch them fall<br>
They won't go when I go<br>
And I'll go where I've longed<br>
To go so long<br>
Away from tears<br>
Unclean minds mislead the pure<br>
The innocent will leave for sure<br>
For them there is a resting place<br>
People sinning just for fun<br>
They will never see the sun<br>
For they can never show their faces<br>
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner<br>
Who will take more than he will give<br>
He ain't hardly gonna give<br>
The greed of man will be<br>
Far away from me<br>
And my soul will be free<br>
They won't go when I go<br>
Since my soul conceived<br>
All that I believe<br>
The kingdom I will see<br>
'Cause they won't go when I go<br>
When I go<br>
Where I'll go<br>
No one can keep me<br>
From my destiny.<br>

Now every ting is lovely<br>
So don't put yu trust inna false prophecy<br>
Dis a de Edley Shine & Stevie<br>
You might wonder<br>
Stand firm to all those who feel concern<br>
Ca when you can't see the light<br>
You must see the Robins in flight<br>
Life is just a matter of time or space<br>
So all those who have to face sorrow<br>
Shall only have to wait till tomorrow<br>
Big tings a guan dis year<br>
So mek we drop inna gear<br>
Come cross missa Stevie Wonder<br>
Watch it!<br>
<br>
Now where do I start to make the point that I'll be making<br>
To most efficiently use your time that I'll be taking<br>
With the clear understanding that every ticking second is precious to us all<br>
But if you let me bend your ear and listen up you will hear<br>
Not just what I say, but every word that I am saying<br>
<br>
You wake in the morning from a dream with spirits dope hype<br>
Though you real life condition is far from being alright<br>
Your love has wronged you, your money's gone, you've lost your home and everything you own<br>
But before you do something major extreme<br>
I've got one simple thing for you to take along with you, as you go on your lonely way<br>
<br>
Tomorrow robins will sing, tomorrow robins will sing<br>
It really is no big thing, cause tomorrow robins will sing<br>
Tomorrow blue jays will fly, the weather forecasts clear skies<br>
So dry those tears from your eyes, cause tomorrow blue jays will fly<br>
<br>
You borrow a dime to call up a friend that you could rely on<br>
They put the phone down, you hear in the background "tell him I'm not home"<br>
Your face is broken, your throat is chokin, you hang up the phone in disbelief<br>
And to make matters worse<br>
You can remember you were the first and only one to come to him when lonely was his everyday<br>
<br>
But if what you did came from your heart and not expecting<br>
Then you should not waste one heart beat on any regretting<br>
The saying's older than old yet true for today as when it was made to be told<br>
As you saw so shall you reap<br>
And if you've treated life sweet<br>
Your blessing's been ordained and already on its way<br>
<br>
Tomorrow robins will sing, tomorrow robins will sing<br>
It really is no big thing, cause tomorrow robins will sing<br>
Tomorrow blue jays will fly, the weather forecasts clear skies<br>
So dry those tears from your eyes, cause tomorrow blue jays will fly<br>
<br>
Today is the tomorrow you were so worried about<br>
Looking over your yesterday<br>
The clouds are gone and the sun is out<br>
And everything has worked out irie okay<br>
<br>
Tomorrow robins will sing, tomorrow robins will sing<br>
It really is no big thing, cause tomorrow robins will sing<br>
Tomorrow blue jays will fly, the weather forecasts clear skies<br>
So dry those tears from your eyes, cause tomorrow blue jays will fly<br>
Tomorrow robins will sing, tomorrow robins will sing<br>
It really is no big thing, cause tomorrow robins will sing.<br>

When the tension's high and I'm feeling low<br>

As a different me, have a new id.<br>

I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head<br>

There's no rich, there's no poor<br>
Everything is love, no such word as "war"<br>
There's no black and no white<br>
Rainbow colors they, dress the days and nights, life's a paradise<br>

Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head<br>

Its amazing how the mind<br>
Can do what you want it to<br>
It can take you to a time<br>
Where you'll want to stay forever<br>
Feeling everlasting pleasure<br>
If your life's in a place<br>
That you can hardly bare<br>
Come along with me to mental ecstasy<br>

True love, why’d you take so long?<br>
Every time I though I’d found you<br>
I was oh so wrong<br>
True love, were you playing with my heart<br>
Or me not trying to feel that<br>
They weren’t it from the start<br>
I’d say yes I found you<br>
And think maybe soI’d say here’s my love true<br>
And feel are you sure?<br>
But love is that feeling<br>
Sharing no room with doubt<br>
For I knew you were the key to my heart<br>
Oh sweet love never go away<br>
Let your love have us forever<br>
To prove why we can’t stay<br>
True love, are you saying touché<br>
Let us live as perfect lovers<br>
With a promise for always<br>

And my dreams are drifting away<br>
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine<br>
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine<br>
I'm afraid the masquerade is over<br>
And so is love, and so is love<br>
Your love and so is love<br>
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise<br>
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes<br>
You look the same<br>
You're a lot the same<br>
But my heart says "No, no, you're not the same"<br>
I'm afraid the masquerade is over<br>
And so is love, and so is love<br>
Your words don't mean what they used to me<br>
They were once inspired, now they're just routine<br>
I'm afraid the masquerade is over<br>

And there?s a toy that pulls<br>
Look, there?s a jingle bell in a dolly<br>

It?s time I saw the miracles<br>
Do you know, that mistletoe<br>
Comes from the holly trees<br>
And do you know, twelve below<br>
Can make the snowman freeze<br>

Do you know an Eskimo<br>
Has ice upon his chin<br>
Do you know that tippy-toe<br>
Is Santa creeping in<br>

La La La La...<br>
Look, there?s a choo-choo train and a rocket<br>
And there?s a bell that rings<br>
Look, there?s a candy cane in your pocket<br>
And so many wondrous things<br>

Do you know, so Long ago<br>
That Christmas had its start yeah<br>
Even though there?s ice and snow<br>
It melts the coldest heart<br>

For when we pray on Christmas Day<br>
A miracle was born, yeah<br>
As we behold the ground is cold<br>
But everyone is warm<br>
Everyone is warm.<br>

And I'm afraid the masquerade is over<br>
And so is love, and so is love<br>
And so is love, and so is love<br>
<br>
Guess I'll have to play Pagliacci<br>
And get a clown's disguise<br>
And learn to live like Pagliacci<br>
With tears in my eyes<br>
You look, you look the same<br>
You're a not the same<br>
But my heart tells me "No, no, you're not the same"<br>
<br>
And I'm afraid the masquerade is over, over<br>
And so is love, and so is love<br>
And so is love, and so is love<br>
Yes it's all over<br>
And so is love.<br>

If I find the end of a rainbow<br>
And if I find that big pot of gold<br>
I vow to give it all to you<br>
What more could I do<br>
<br>
If I had the lamp of Aladin<br>
I'll tell the genie just what to do<br>
To take all the treasures<br>
In the whole wide world<br>
And give them all to you<br>
<br>
And I love you because<br>
<br>
When I'm bad sometimes<br>
And you know I am wrong<br>
Your understanding<br>
Helps me to be strong<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>
I simply thank you<br>
For all the things you taught me<br>
Those things you brought me<br>
<br>
When I need the stairway to heaven<br>
I'd be so proud<br>
You showed me the way<br>
I'd be so glad that I have a mother<br>
Like you to love me<br>
All the way through<br>
<br>
All the way, all the way<br>
All the way, all the way<br>
<br>
I'll be so glad that I have a mother<br>
Like you to love me<br>
All the way through<br>
<br>
Thank you, thank you, thank you. thank you<br>
I'll be so glad that I have a mother<br>

Something deep inside of me<br>
Keeps me moving aimlessly<br>
Always been Always be<br>
A lonely travelin' man<br>
Something that I can't explain<br>
Holding me from wind and rain<br>
Wild and free and hard to tame<br>
A lonely travelin' man<br>
<br>
Travelin' Man<br>
Travelin' Man<br>
Got no goal got no plan<br>
Just an old worn out heart in my hand<br>
Travelin' Man<br>
Travelin' Man<br>
I'll get there anyway I can<br>
I'm just an uninspiring tired out travelin' man<br>
<br>
Please don't ask me where I've been<br>
I've been alone through thick and thin<br>
On the outside looking in<br>
A lonely travelin' man<br>
<br>
Something that I haven't found<br>
Keeps me seeking all around<br>
Moving on from town to town<br>
A lonely travelin' man<br>

Travelin' Man<br>

Got no goal got no plan<br>

Baby, I knew at once that<br>
You were meant for me<br>
Deep in my soul I know<br>
That I'm your destiny<br>
Though you're unsure<br>
Why fight the tide<br>
Don't think so much<br>
Let your heart decide<br>
<br>
Baby, I see your future<br>
And it's tied to mine<br>
I look in your eyes and see<br>
You searching for a sign<br>
But you'll never fall<br>
Till you let go<br>
Don't be so scared<br>
Of what you don't know<br>
<br>
True to you heart<br>
You must be true<br>
To your heart<br>
That's when the<br>
Heavens will part<br>
And baby, shower you<br>
With my love<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Your heart can tell<br>
You no lies<br>
And when you're true<br>
To your heart<br>
I know it's gonna lead<br>
You straight to me<br>
(Got to be true<br>
To your heart)<br>
<br>
Someone you know is on<br>
Your side, can set you free<br>
I can do that for you if<br>
You believe in me<br>
Why second-guess<br>
What feels so right<br>
Just trust your heart<br>
And you'll see the light<br>
<br>
True to you heart<br>
You must be true<br>
To your heart<br>
That's when the<br>
Heavens will part<br>
And baby, shower you<br>
With my love<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Your heart can tell<br>
You no lies<br>
And when you're true<br>
To your heart<br>
I know it's gonna lead<br>
You straight to me<br>
<br>
(Ya know it's true)<br>
Your heart knows<br>
What's good for you<br>
(Good for you)<br>
Let your heart show<br>
You the way<br>
(Ya know it's true)<br>
It'll see you through<br>
(Got to be true<br>
To your heart)<br>
<br>
Girl, my heart is driving<br>
Me to where you are<br>
Well, you can take both hands off<br>
The wheel and still get far<br>
Be swept away<br>
Enjoy the ride<br>
You won't get lost<br>
With your heart to guide you<br>
<br>
True to you heart<br>
You must be true<br>
To your heart<br>
That's when the<br>
Heavens will part<br>
And baby, shower you<br>
With my love<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Your heart can tell you no lies<br>
And when you're true<br>
To your heart<br>
I know it's gonna lead<br>
You straight to me<br>
<br>
True to you heart<br>
You must be true<br>
To your heart<br>
That's when the<br>
Heavens will part<br>
And baby, shower you<br>
With my love<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Your heart will tell you no lies<br>
And when it's true<br>
To your heart<br>
I know it's gonna lead<br>
You straight to me<br>
(Got to be true<br>
To your heart)<br>
<br>
When things are getting' crazy<br>
And you don't know<br>
Where to start<br>
Keep on believin', baby<br>
Just be true to your heart<br>
When all the world<br>
Around you<br>
It seems to fall apart<br>
Keep on believin', baby<br>
Just be true to your heart.<br>

Tragedy feels like a melody<br>
We've got to listen to<br>
From time to time<br>
<br>
History feels like a part of me<br>
Is every century<br>
A spiral we all climb?<br>
<br>
I guess time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
<br>
Is there something here to find<br>
Something invisible--underlined?<br>
And could it possible be<br>
That everything might some day<br>
Come clear for me?<br>
<br>
I guess time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
<br>
I guess time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
<br>
You don't need me to tell you<br>
What's gone wrong<br>
You know what's going on<br>
<br>
I guess time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all<br>
Time will teach us all.<br>

But you get swept to the top of a swirl<br>
And one fine girl comes to rock his world<br>
<br>
So they might find Mr. pick-up artist<br>
You're not one of the smartest<br>
You're a pick-up man, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
(Stevie)<br>
Go go go Mr. pick-up artist<br>
