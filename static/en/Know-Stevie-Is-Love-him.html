    <font color="#00FFFF">To know Stevie is to love him</font>. That is a phrase that can be repeated over seven decades in which Stevie Wonder has shared his life with us. His joys with the birth of his children, the illusions in his sentimental life, his complaint against the injustices that surround us, or his sadness over the disappearance of loved ones.

<div class="grid_7" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
    Good and bad moments that have resulted in a sea of emotions in which we have plunged into for impregnated of love, passion, pain..., life in short.
    <br><br>
    <font color="#00FFFF">To Know You Is To Love You</font> define perfectly that feeling I want to express. A song that Stevie built together one of the women of his life, <a href="Syreeta.html">Syreeta Wright</a>, with which he shared many happy moments in his life, and also wounds difficult to heal as was his death.
    <br><br>
    To know him is to love him, yes. Because his music twinning us, it unites us, at the same time creates an invisible bond that pushes us to try to be better every day. Stevie Wonder recovers from the blow that involved surgery for a kidney transplant. His health at the moment is the most important, but we know that his inner strength is powerful and full of energy, as when he recovered from coma in the 70s after a <a href="Milagro-Stevie.html">accident of traffic</a>. "To know You Is To Love You", you wrote in the 70's, but in this new decade of the 20's, we can say without a doubt that <font color="#00FFFF">to know you is to love you</font>.

    To know you is to love you<br>
    But to know me is not that way you see<br>
    Yet you made me yeah so happy<br>
    That my love for you grows endlessly<br>
<br>


    When I am sad and feeling down<br>
    You always comfort me<br>
    When I am sad and feeling down<br>
    You always comfort me<br>

Baby, to know you is to love you<br>
You smile when I see your face<br>
'Cause there ain't no one this earth<br>
Baby, could ever, ever take your place<br>
<br>


When I am sad and feeling down<br>
    You always comfort me<br>
    When I am sad and feeling down<br>
    You always comfort me<br>
<br>


Oh, To know you is to love you<br>
Is the same as being free as the wind<br>
For the power of your loving<br>
To be strong to hold it safe within<br>
<br>


To know you is to love you<br>
To see you blowing free in the breeze<br>
The power of your loving<br>
I never found a woman like you<br>
That could be my lover<br>
<br>


And my best friend<br>
