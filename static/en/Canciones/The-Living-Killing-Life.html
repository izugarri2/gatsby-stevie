[Intro: Rapsody]<br>
It's the R-A-P-S-O-D-Y<br>
Yo<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Rapsody]<br>
History say don't repeat her<br>
Many years a slave, took notes from the Peter<br>
You should marvel at the fightin', feel like Anitta<br>
Apologize, you denied my people<br>
Made our death legal, we all paralegal<br>
Gotta defend ourselves when the laws ain't equal<br>
Cops aim lethal, death in cathedrals<br>
Bang, bang boogie, you could die wearin' a hoodie, bow<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Cordae]<br>
Yeah, uh<br>
Alright, sometimes we gotta find our creator<br>
If I defeated Father Time, was raised by Mother Nature<br>
In the projects, tenement walls, sudden withdrawals<br>
A true rebel is easy to spot the government flaws<br>
Mass confusion, people in power commit collusion<br>
Indoctrinated students, I'm the leader of the movement<br>
Take lifetimes, tryna duck the school-to-prison pipeline<br>
Disenfranchised, amazin' I'm in my right mind<br>
Create change, survive, struggle to maintain<br>
So many lies within the campaign, a damn shame<br>
I'm thinkin' how will we survive<br>
When the freedom that we have's a façade? Yeah<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Stevie Wonder]<br>
You say you're sick and tired of us protesting<br>
I say, "Not time enough to make a change"<br>
You say, "Just keep holdin' on"<br>
I say "No, way, 'cause we can't put it in the hands of fate"<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, now baby<br>
You say that you believe in all lives matter<br>
I say, I don't believe the fuck you do<br>
You say, "All things in time"<br>
I say, that's why I'm not gonna put it in the hands of fate<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Stevie Wonder]<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Not gon' put it in the hands of fate now, baby<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
No, no, no, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
In the not so distant tomorrow<br>
Robins will sing your lullaby<br>
But I've seen too many of our generations<br>
Live and die for that pie in the sky, not I<br>
<br>
[Verse 4: Stevie Wonder]<br>
You say, "Those innocent lives should've not been taken"<br>
And I say, "For them, it's why we take a knee"<br>
You say, "Is that the right lane"<br>
I say, "First Amendment everyday"<br>
'Cause we can't put it in the hands of fate<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Stevie Wonder]<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
No, no, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
We can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Come on<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
In the not so distant tomorrow<br>
Robins will sing your lullaby<br>
But I've seen too many of our generations<br>
Live and die for that pie in the sky, not I<br>
<br>
[Verse 5: CHIKA]<br>
Yeah, we went from fields into a field<br>
Bodies hit the ground, and so we gotta take a kneel<br>
Mothers missin', kid's attorneys say they oughta take a deal<br>
They determine that the prize of life is just a couple mill<br>
And bricks are meant to build, and fires meant to light<br>
And souls are meant to rest and living soldiers gotta fight<br>
We don't need no politics to try to justify the plight<br>
It's a problem of the people, it's no longer black and white<br>
<br>
[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]<br>
Look<br>
So, we ain't talkin' no more, we gettin' to it<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, this how we do it<br>
Now let me go and get with all of my people, you know I have to get<br>
That'll show me sacrifice just like my brother Colin Kaepernick<br>
Opportunities that I get to talk, you know I have to spit<br>
Breonna Taylor turn in her grave, you know we have to get justice<br>
And stay in your place, we still focused on the outcome of George Floyd case<br>
While you out here doin' the minimal, hah<br>
Everything about us still live by the principle<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
<br>
[Verse 7: Stevie Wonder]<br>
You say now you really truly get it<br>
I say, "How much you do will let me know"<br>
You say, "I'm so ready"<br>
I say, "Let's do this, and not just put it in the hands of fate"<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Stevie Wonder]<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
No, no, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
We can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
No, no, no, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
No<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
No, no, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
No<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
No, no, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Oh, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Oh, no, no, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Oh, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Oh, no, no, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
No, no, no<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait<br>
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
