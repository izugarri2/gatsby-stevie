The Beatles, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye ... and how not <font color="#00FFFF">Bob Marley</font>. For a lover of music, as Stevie Wonder is, falling prey to new expressions and musical forms was predictable and inevitable. The world had discovered in the mid-70's a new style that came from Jamaica with African influences, the <font color="#00FFFF">Reggae</font>. A new way of understanding the music that evolved from the evolution of ska and rocksteady in the Jamaica of the 60's. In a cheerful, repetitive and marked rhythm, their melodies were soft, without stridencies, giving great importance to lyrics committed in Favor of peace and aid to the Third World.</div>

Highly identified by the movement and ideology Rastafaris, it was the perfect channel for the American and European black people to channel their needs. <font color="#00FFFF">Stevie Wonder</font> -who during this decade of the 70's became fully involved in denouncing social injustices, while reflecting the perceived society- shared poster along with <font color="#00FFFF">Bob Marley and the original members of The Wailers at the Wonder Dream Concert</font> which took place at the Kingston National Stadium on October 4, 1975. There about thirty songs and thousands of people were witnessed a unique event, with the generous donation of the total proceeds to the Jamaica Institute of the Blind.

Years later, at the festival “<font color="#00FFFF">Black Music Association</font>” that took place at the Sheraton Philadelphia in 1979, again the symbiosis between the two musicians on stage playing "Get up, Stand up" was total. This was the seed that came one year after the birth of one of Stevie Wonder's many iconic songs, "<font color="#00FFFF">Master Blaster (Jammin ')</font>".
<br><br>
The song of clear influence Reggae, fresh air painted Motown outdoors of the hand of Stevie Wonder, and was all the homage to his friend Bob Marley that fought against the cancer that detected to him years ago. The song was part of the album <a href="1980-Hotter-than-july.html">Hotter Than July</a> of the year 1980, reaching great popularity in the whole world. Bob Marley died a few months later, on May 11, 1981.

Other of these points of union between both is the song “<font color="#00FFFF">Redemption Song</font>”. Composed by Bob Marley in 1979, already aware of the cancer he possessed, his mood was one of deep depression and sadness. Remote of the characteristic Reggae style, initially it only was recorded with the guitar and his voice, being later edited with the voice of Bob and instrumentalized by The Wailers. He expressed the ideals of the Rastafarian movement and the liberation of the people from their own mental impositions. Stevie Wonder performs a fantastic version of a clearer style of ballads, replaces the acoustic guitar with a cozy electric, and incorporates percussions and new sounds. Included in a 1996 compilation called <a href="1996-Song-Review.html">Song Review: Greatest Hits</a>.

<font color="#00FFFF">Two legends of music, two free spirits, two geniuses of the rhythms ...</font>, two friends who processed mutual admiration for what they shared; Music, love, peace and freedom. The chemistry that existed between them We did could not again to contemplate, Since Bob Marley's disease, prevented the joint tour that they planned to realize at the end of 1980.But with us, always will remain the positive posion of his passage by our planet in the form of a philosophy Of life, and songs that well under his creation, or by his inspiration, have helped to the creation of a better world.

Everyone's feeling pretty<br>
  It's hotter than July<br>
  Though the world's full of problems<br>
  They couldn't touch us even if they tried<br>
  From the park I hear rhythms<br>
  Marley's hot on the box<br>
  Tonight there will be a party<br>
  On the corner at the end of the block<br>
  <br>
  Didn't know you<br>
  Would be jammin' until the break of dawn<br>
  I bet nobody ever told you that you<br>
  would be jammin' until the break of dawn<br>
  You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on<br>
  <br>
  They want us to join their fighting<br>
  But our answer today<br>
  Is to let all our worries<br>
  Like the breeze through our fingers slip away<br>
  Peace has come to Zimbabwe<br>
  Third World's right on the one<br>
  Now's the time for celebration<br>
  'Cause we've only just begun<br>
  <br>
  Didn't know that you<br>
  Would be jammin' until the break of dawn<br>
