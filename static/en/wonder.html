            <div class="grid_12" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
              A while ago I read an article that "beleaguered" the existence of the last decades of music from <font color="#00FFFF">Stevie Wonder</font>, I am
              surprised at the antagonistic attitude in a later article about the Beatles, lifting it almost to the status of gods, is that true circumstances
              prevented us from the obvious what would have been able to determine its future in the world of music, but as an example, we have <font color="#00FFFF">Paul
                McCartney</font>, who along with John Lennon were the mainstays of the group, and since then little can be said for his creativity and existence in
              recent decades.
            </div>
            <div class="grid_4 rightfloat" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
              <center><img src="images/sigue.jpg" alt="Stevie is still Wonder"></center>
            </div>
            <div class="grid_8" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
              Stevie Wonder is no doubt that creative explosion was in the seventies, with songs difficult to overcome, not only for himself but for any of the
              artists that today we are trying to overshadow the multinationals. It is clear that the music has evolved and will continue to do so during the next
              years or decades, but if there is something that define and will define a true artist is his ability to make us vibrate with his lyrics, with his
              notes, with his voice...
              <br>

            </div>
            <div class="grid_12" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
              In this way, Stevie Wonder, nearly fifty years after his first public appearance in the song "<font color="#00FFFF">Fingertips</font>", can show us
              again that he can excite and thrill the audience for nearly three hours of concert, show his talent and generosity, little may be required to who give
              all!, and if that is a lot, the words are not necessary.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">

            <div class="grid_12" style="padding-bottom:30px;"><br>
              This way Stevie thanked his fans to follow there, giving part of his life in his performances, sharing with us their sorrows as the death of his
              mother, his joys and the births of their children, their rage and pain at the injustices of everyday life. I have not the slightest doubt the veracity
              of a man who, despite the many successes and praise the day that is overwhelmed, it has lost the north and remains the same simple and close to that
              in the beginning surprised all around him at all, and many, who have shared with him at some point in their life in a recording studio, in a scene in
              a song or simply an "be prepared" to help you.
            </div>
            <div class="grid_12" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
              The future is near and you can almost touch it, their projects in the studio with an album dedicated to his mother (<font color="#00FFFF">Gospel
                Inspired by Lula</font>) to pass away in 2006, as well as other work (<font color="#00FFFF">Through The Eyes Of Wonder</font>) which seek to express
              with his music as "see" the world around us for a person born blind as he is. <br>
              <br>
              Yes, if there was a time when Stevie was wonder, but that time has never passed, the ticking of the clock was stopped and the magic has made possible
              remain <font color="#00FFFF">Stevie Wonder is still wonder</font>.
