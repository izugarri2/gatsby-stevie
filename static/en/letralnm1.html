You were brought up in a small town<br>
Where everyone greeted with a morning smile<br>
I mean the place was so free from crime<br>
You could leave your front door open<br>
And if your eyes were drawn from a lack of food<br>
Or your pockets were short on cash<br>
There was always someone close at hand<br>
That you could always run to<br>
<br>
You could have been a doctor<br>
And you could have been a nurse<br>
But these things weren't good enough for you<br>
So you decided to pack up all you own<br>
And get a one-way ticket there<br>
To a place where all the successful people went<br>
In order for them to do<br>
<br>
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl<br>
Remember only the strong can survive<br>
Living in the land of la la<br>
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl<br>
Remember only the strong can survive<br>
Living in the land of la la<br>
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, land of la la<br>
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, the land of la la<br>
<br>
You get off the bus, pick up a paper<br>
And look through the classified<br>
So that you might find a place<br>
Suitable for you to move into<br>
Then you turn around to pick up the duffle bag<br>
That you brought along<br>
But much to your surprise you find<br>
Your bag has taken off walking<br>
<br>
You dig in your wallet<br>
To get your last dime<br>
But then recall you just spent your last dime on the newspaper<br>
You're much too prideful<br>
But pride has no defense<br>
When all you've got in your possession<br>
Is the wallet in your hands<br>
<br>
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl<br>
Remember only the strong can survive<br>
Living in the land of la la<br>
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl<br>
Remember only the strong can survive<br>
Living in the land of la la<br>
(repetir)<br>
<br>
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, living in the land of la la<br>
(repetir)<br>
<br>
You might get everything you want<br>
But not want everything you get<br>
Being in la la land is like nowhere else<br>
Living in the land, one hell of a land, a land full of lost angels<br>
Movie stars and great big cars and Perrier and fun all day<br>
And that's enough to make anybody go wild<br>
In the land of la la<br>
He's a big boy now, she's a strong girl<br>
But only the strong can survive<br>
Living in the land of la la<br>

Lately, I have had the strangest feeling<br>
With no vivid reason here to find<br>
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging<br>
'round my mind<br>
<br>
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume<br>
With you say no special place to go<br>
But when I ask will you be coming back soon<br>
You don't know, never know<br>
<br>
Well, I'm a man of many wishes<br>
Hope my premonition misses<br>
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide<br>
'Cause they always start to cry<br>
'Cause this time could mean goodbye<br>
<br>
Lately I've been staring in the mirror<br>
Very slowly picking me apart<br>
Trying to tell myself I have no reason<br>
with your heart<br>
<br>
Just the other night while you were sleeping<br>
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name<br>
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping<br>
You just say nothing's changed<br>
<br>
Well, I'm a man of many wishes<br>
I hope my premonition misses<br>
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide<br>
'Cause they always start to cry<br>
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye<br>
<br>
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes<br>
I hope my premonition misses<br>
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide<br>
'Cause they always start to cry<br>
'Cause this time could mean goodbye<br>

No time to wallow in the mire<br>
Try now we can only lose<br>
And our love become a funeral pyre<br>

A boy is born in hard time mississippi<br>
Surrounded by four walls that aint so pretty<br>
His parents give him love and affection<br>
To keep him strong moving in the right direction<br>
Living just enough, just enough for the city...ee ha!<br>
<br>
His father works some days for fourteen hours<br>
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar<br>
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many<br>
And youd best believe she hardly gets a penny<br>
Living just enough, just enough for the city... yeah!<br>
<br>
His sisters black but she is shonuff pretty<br>
Her skirt is short but lord her legs are sturdy<br>
To walk to school shes got to get up early<br>
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty<br>
Living just enough, just enough for the city...um hum<br>
<br>
Her brothers smart hes got more sense than many<br>
His patiences long but soon he wont have any<br>
To find a job is like a haystack needle<br>
Cause where he lives they dont use colored people<br>
Living just enough, just enough for the city...<br>
<br>
Living just enough...<br>
For the city... ooh, ooh<br>
(Repetir varias veces)<br>
<br>
His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty<br>
He spends his life walking the streets of new york city<br>
Hes almost dead from breathing in air pollution<br>
He tried to vote but to him theres no solution<br>
Living just enough, just enough for the city...<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah!<br>
<br>
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow<br>
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow<br>
This place is cruel no where could be much colder<br>
If we dont change the world will soon be over<br>
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city!!!!<br>

We are idle strangers<br>
Married to our dangers<br>
Into space we go to change our ways<br>
<br>
Flying to our heavens<br>
We are all together<br>
Into hell we chase the light of day<br>
<br>
Look around and you'll see<br>
Ruins of the human history<br>
Look around and you'll see<br>
Time is only floating in your mind<br>
You will find<br>
Searching for time<br>
Empty is your mind<br>
<br>
We are charmed by living<br>
Dazzled into giving<br>
All the waste we plan to ignore<br>
<br>
Coldness is the virtue<br>
Measured by the untrue<br>
Love is used for something but what for?<br>

Never tears or sorrows came before me in my mind,<br>

Never a worry on my mind.<br>

All my days before today were happy,<br>
And secure until your phone call,<br>
You were tellin' me goodbye.<br>

I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life,<br>
And I'm lookin' for another love,<br>
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life.<br>

Now the wheel of fate has turned,<br>
I'm worried 'bout the new love you've discovered,<br>
He is a problem in my life,<br>
I have a problem on my mind.<br>

Things you cherish most in your life,<br>
Can be taken if they're left neglected,<br>
Leavin' a problem in your life.<br>

I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life, ooh,<br>

You said there would be warm love in springtime<br>
That was when you started to be cold<br>
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer<br>
But now I find myself all alone<br>

You said then you'd be the life in autumn<br>

I met her at lover's park<br>
One rainy April Monday<br>
Smiling soft and warm as on<br>
A clear December Sunday<br>
Wearing taffeta and lace<br>
That matched her braided hair<br>
With their coraled beads that sang to me<br>
<br>
She said " hi " and asked me why<br>
Was I looking with sorrow<br>
When there were much brighter days<br>
In store for me tomorrow<br>
<br>
I looked up at her and smiled<br>
And said, why I don't know<br>
But would she agree, to stay with me<br>
And she said<br>
Never in your sun, she said<br>
Never in your sun, then she said<br>
I will only come<br>
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain<br>
<br>
So if you are at lover's park<br>
And someone looks with sorrow<br>
Ask them why are they so sad<br>
When sunshine's theirs tomorrow<br>
They'll reply they don't know why<br>
And ask you please to stay<br>
'til the end of time, and when they're fine<br>
<br>
Be kind and say<br>
Never in your sun, just tell them<br>
Never in your sun, then say<br>
I will only come<br>
In your pouring rain, to relieve the pain, never, ever<br>
Never in your sun, never in your sun, believe that<br>
I will only come<br>
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain<br>

 I'm the luckiest guy in the world<br>

 To show my cookie a real good time, because<br>

Ways you've never felt<br>
But are you sure, make sure you're sure<br>

Well, the wine is sweet<br>
And the music sways<br>
And your lips are so divine<br>
And you say you know<br>
That you're falling in love<br>
Now, let's be mature, make sure you're sure<br>
<br>
I'm not accustomed to wearing my feelings<br>
In a place that's so obvious to see<br>
But if eyes don't lie<br>
There's a chance that you are not fooling yourself<br>
and me<br>
<br>
Well the night is through<br>
And the sun's come out<br>
And so too has your lovely smile<br>
And you vow to stay<br>
In these arms always<br>
Can you endure, now are you sure<br>

Love can be so insecure<br>

Everyone's feeling pretty<br>
It's hotter than July<br>
Though the world's full of problems<br>
They couldn't touch us even if they tried<br>
From the park I hear rhythms<br>
Marley's hot on the box<br>
Tonight there will be a party<br>
On the corner at the end of the block<br>
<br>
Didn't know you<br>
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn<br>
I bet nobody ever told you that you<br>
would be jammin' until the break of dawn<br>
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on<br>
<br>
They want us to join their fighting<br>
But our answer today<br>
Is to let all our worries<br>
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away<br>
Peace has come to Zimbabwe<br>
Third World's right on the one<br>
Now's the time for celebration<br>
'Cause we've only just begun<br>
<br>
Didn't know that you<br>
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn<br>
Bet you nobody ever told you that you<br>
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn<br>
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on<br>
Bet you nobody ever told you that you<br>
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')<br>
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn<br>
I know nobody told you that you<br>

Would be jammin' until the break of dawn<br>
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on<br>
<br>
You ask me am I happy<br>
Well as matter of fact<br>
I can say that I'm ecstatic<br>
'Cause we all just made a pact<br>
We've agreed to get together<br>
Joined as children in Jah<br>
When you're moving in the positive<br>
Your destination is the brightest star<br>
<br>
You didn't know that you<br>
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')<br>

Tender, warm and serene<br>
Are the words that might come close to having<br>
Remnants of the feelings that we can no longer hide<br>
Mighty, shining and clear<br>
Are but mere expressions that don't come near<br>
To the ever glowing eminence of light in our eyes tonight<br>
<br>
'Cause moments aren't moments<br>
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours<br>
And magic's not magic<br>
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts<br>
Feeling with tender love-bloom<br>
<br>
Gentle, quiet, so soft<br>
Are the wings of love that can send us off<br>
To an ever splendor unknown to all in our time<br>
Trusting in the unknown and giving in to what feelings have shown<br>
Will take us to altered intimacies in our lives<br>
Where we'll find<br>
<br>
That moments aren't moments<br>
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours<br>
And magic's not magic<br>
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts<br>

When will you come again<br>
I wait in darkness just for your bright to beam<br>

'Cause I'm not afraid of the consequence<br>
Of being in love with you<br>
And I'd rather be alone some nights<br>
Awaiting your full hue<br>
For though the sun makes bright the day<br>
My world is dark when there's no you<br>
You light my skies and make dark night bright day, Moon blue<br>
<br>
Moon blue, your beauty's seen by all, the yearning of your call<br>
Travels the world and then makes home my soul<br>
Moon blue, lift me to starry heights, I long to live within your light<br>
Solace of mind, my heart is yours for always<br>

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me<br>
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br>
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me<br>
In a jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you<br>
<br>
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand<br>
Vanished from my hand left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping<br>
My weariness amazes me I'm branded on my feet<br>
I have no one to meet and the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming<br>
<br>
Coros<br>

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship<br>
My senses have been stripped my hands can't feel to grip<br>
My toes too numb to step wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'<br>
I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade<br>
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it<br>

Though you might hear laughin' spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun<br>
It's not aimed at anyone it's just escapin' on the run<br>
And but for the sky there are no fences facing<br>
<br>
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme<br>
To your tambourine in time it's just a ragged clown behind<br>
I wouldn't pay it any mind it's just a shadow you're seein' that he's chasing<br>
<br>
Coros<br>
<br>
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind<br>
Down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves<br>
The haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach<br>
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow<br>
<br>
Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free<br>
Silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands<br>
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves<br>
Let me forget about today until tomorrow<br>
<br>
Coros<br>

What is that that you're looking through<br>
a por()ographic magazine?<br>
When I bet you don't even know how to<br>
spell the word<br>
And you say you don't leave home unless<br>
you';re strapped<br>
With your uzi sub machine<br>
When you've just barely<br>
come into this world<br>
Well, if a child's ways and actions<br>
Reflect what they hear and see<br>
Guess the only ones to blame are you and me<br>
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones<br>
Look what's happened to our world<br>
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones<br>
We're so sorry<br>
The only chance for a better one<br>
Is up to you and he<br>
Please! Forgive us for what we've done<br>
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones<br>
What kind of name is that<br>
you're calling her<br>
I've heard that word before<br>
But I don't think any<br>
parent would give their<br>
daughter a name so low<br>
And about this extra paraphernalia<br>
You say you're carrying to get high<br>
That won't take you anywhere you want to go<br>
Well, you don't have to listen<br>
Cause it's here for you to see<br>
So many burnt out lives<br>
trapped in their misery<br>
<br>

<br>
My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day<br>
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way<br>
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore<br>
You're the only girl my heart beats for<br>
How I wish that you were mine<br>
<br>
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street<br>
I've been near you, but you never noticed me<br>
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore<br>
That behind that little smile I wore<br>
How I wish that you were mine<br>
<br>
La la la la la la, La la la la la la<br>
La la la la la la, La la la la la la<br>
<br>
Maybe someday, you'll see my face amoung the crowd<br>
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud<br>
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore<br>
You're the only girl my heart beats for<br>
How I wish that you were mine<br>

I was a lonely no one<br>
Living in a vacuum as life's debris<br>
Victimized as one whose self deprivation<br>
Had made for my outer insecurity<br>
<br>
I was a he ain't nothin'<br>
Living in the slums of love's misery<br>
Starving from the lack of sweet affection<br>
'Til you came to rescue me<br>
<br>
My eyes don't cry no more<br>
My heart don't ache no more<br>
Since you walked through my door<br>
I don't have to no longer be blue<br>
<br>
My eyes don't cry no more<br>
My heart don't ache no more<br>
Now taht love's touched my soul<br>
All my lonely nights alone are through<br>
<br>
I was a Mr Lonely<br>
Seeing only darkness in the bright of day<br>
Blind even though my eyes were wide opened<br>
But then your love sunshined my way<br>
<br>
My eyes don't cry no more<br>
My heart don't ache no more<br>
Since you walked through my door<br>
I don't have to no longer be blue
<br>
My eyes don't cry no more<br>
My heart don't ache no more<br>
Now taht love's touched my soul<br>
All my lonely nights alone are through<br>
<br>
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry<br>
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry<br>
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry<br>
(repeat)<br>
<br>
My life was without reason<br>
Sinking in a hell that had no space or time<br>
Falling to the burning pit of pain and sorrow<br>
Until you saved this life of mine<br>
<br>
My eyes don't cry no more<br>
My heart don't ache no more<br>
Since you walked through my door<br>
I don't have to no longer be blue<br>
<br>
My eyes don't cry no more<br>
My heart don't ache no more<br>
Now taht love's touched my soul<br>
All my lonely nights alone are through<br>
<br>
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry<br>
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry<br>
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry<br>
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry<br>
<br>
My eyes don't cry no more<br>
My heart don't ache no more<br>
My nights are not lonely no more<br>
My tears don't flow no more<br>
My eyes don't cry, my eyes don't cry,<br>
My eyes don't cry no more<br>

Look at how they stop and stare<br>
As if they've never seen a heart in love<br>
And though I see them I don't care<br>
Cuz, I'm too busy thinking bout our love<br>
<br>
Thinking about that each and every morning<br>
I wake up to that love glow in your eyes<br>
And though it seems I'm hooked on this fixation<br>
I will not stop my daydreaming<br>
Until my nights are true with you<br>
Ooh baby, my love is on fire<br>
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild<br>
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire<br>
I want to feel your love<br>
I need to feel your love mixed with mine<br>
Listen at me call your name<br>
As if you're witness to my every word<br>
And though it seems sometimes insane<br>
Something within me tells me they'll be heard<br>
So I wait so patiently the moment<br>
When my love fantasies will come to life<br>
And all I need from you is confirmation<br>
Then I'll be living truth, those moments<br>
That I long with you<br>
Ooh baby, my love is on fire<br>
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild<br>
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire<br>
I want to feel your love<br>
I need to feel your love mixed with mine<br>
<br>
(On flute, Hubert Laws)<br>
<br>
And all I need from you is confirmation<br>
Then I'll be living truth, those moments<br>
That I long with you<br>
<br>
Ooh baby, my love is on fire<br>
Ooh baby, my heart is on the wild<br>
Ooh baby, I'm burning with desire<br>
I want to feel your love<br>
I need to feel your love mixed with mine<br>

I was just walking down the street<br>
Looking forward to seeing the friends I was to meet<br>
Yet what happened so tragically<br>
Really makes for no sense at all<br>
Suddenly two guys confronted me<br>
Saying I was on the wrong turf, angrily<br>
They said their colors were black but I was wearing gray<br>
I started to turn to go back<br>
They up and blew me away<br>
<br>
My love is with you where ever you are<br>
My love is with you, where ever you are (repetir)<br>
<br>
Though my life they've taken<br>
They can't take what we've shared<br>
Spread the love I've given<br>
And I'll be there<br>
<br>
I was out playing with my friends<br>
You know, doing those silly things kids do at ten<br>
But the crossfire I was caught in<br>
Should not have been in the first place<br>
A dropped Monte Carlo came to a screech<br>
Someone yelled "nobody gets away with dissen me"<br>
Across the street a man pulled his nine<br>
Everybody started to run<br>
A shower of bullets rang out<br>
Mistakenly my life was done, oh<br>
<br>
My love is with you where ever you are<br>
My love is with you, where ever you are (repetir)<br>
<br>
Though my life they've taken<br>
They can't take what we've shared<br>
Spread the love I've given<br>
I'll be there<br>
<br>
My love is with you where ever you are<br>
My love is with you, where ever you are (repetir)<br>
<br>
When you're joyful<br>
When you're lonely<br>
When you're happy<br>
When tears are streamin right down your face<br>
In the morning<br>
In the noon time<br>
In the evening<br>
In the wee wee hours of the nighttime hour<br>
In the summer<br>
In the springtime<br>
In the autumn<br>
In the cold long winter, winter nights<br>
My love is with you<br>
My love is with you my best friend<br>
My love is with you my brother<br>
My love is with you my sister<br>
My love is with you my mother<br>
My love is with you my father<br>
I'm with you - (repetir)<br>
Ban the hand gun - chant<br>

My world is empty without you, babe<br>
My world is empty without you, babe<br>
<br>
And as I go my way alone,<br>
I find it hard for me to carry on<br>
I need your strength, I need your tender touch<br>
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much<br>
<br>
My world is empty without you, babe<br>
My world is empty without you, babe<br>
<br>
From this whole world, I try to hide my face<br>
But from this loneliness, there's no hiding place<br>
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell<br>
In darkness with memories I know so well<br>
<br>
I need your love more than before<br>
I can hardly carry on anymore<br>
<br>
My world is empty without you, babe<br>
Without you, babe, without you, babe<br>
<br>
My mind and soul have felt like this<br>
Since love between us, no more exists<br>
And each time that darkness falls,<br>
It finds me alone with these four walls<br>
<br>
My world is empty without you, babe<br>
Without you, babe, without you, babe<br>
<br>
Without you, babe, without you, babe<br>

In 1492, you came upon these shores<br>
700 years, educated by the Moors<br>
17th Century, genocide and the gun<br>
Middle passage blessed to market the Africans<br>
In the so called land of God<br>
My kind were treated hard<br>
<br>
From back then until now<br>
I see, and you?ll agree<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
From back then until now<br>
Just see, my family tree<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
<br>
19th century, slavery destroyed<br>
Soldiers who fought and won<br>
<br>
Once known as "Nigger Boys"<br>
20th century, with freedom in our hands<br>
We invent ideas which help to save the land<br>
But while I pray to God<br>
My moms and pops died hard<br>
<br>
From back then until now<br>
You?ll see, our history<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
From back then until now<br>
Just see, my family tree<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
Yes, We have been a misrepresented people<br>
<br>
1969, Black powers at the door<br>
1982, Hip hoppers on the floor<br>
1992, gangsta crack prevails<br>
1999, our colors fill the jails<br>
It is through the grace of God<br>
That we all were not scarred<br>
<br>
From back then until now<br>
We see no comedy<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
From back then until now<br>
Were we still a mystery<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
<br>
Though we march across time<br>
None see our victories<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
From back then until now<br>
You know we made you grow<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
We have been a misrepresented people<br>
<br>
From back then until now<br>
We see our destiny<br>
To never be a misrepresented people<br>
Yes we march across time<br>
To free all humanity<br>
To never be a misrepresented people<br>
No, no, you must never be a misrepresented people.<br>
