Born to open for<br>
Mankind nature's door<br>
A life known by a few<br>
<br>
And those who knew that shared<br>
Their knowledge fewer cared<br>
About what plants could do<br>
<br>
For most felt it was mad to conceive<br>
That plants thought, felt, and moved quite like we<br>
But with instruments Bose would devise<br>
Would take Science itself by a surprise, so<br>
<br>
On we go to where who knows<br>
To a place where there's still non-believers<br>
What will it take for heaven sakes<br>
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in<br>
It's that same old story again.<br>
<br>
Born of slaves who died<br>
Too soon to realize<br>
The need his life would be<br>
<br>
Selflessy he gave<br>
His wisdom to a way<br>
Where first no minds would see<br>
<br>
He said if farm land was to be rich<br>
We must plant crops to replenish it<br>
But it took him persuasion and tests<br>
To convince them Canver's way was best, so<br>
<br>
On we go to where who knows<br>
To a place where there's still non-believers<br>
What will it take for heaven sakes<br>
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in<br>
It's that same old story again.<br>

Packing my bags -- going away<br>
To a place where the air is clean<br>
On Saturn<br>
There's no sense to sit and watch people die<br>
We don't fight our wars the way you do<br>
We put back all the things we use<br>
On Saturn<br>
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes<br>
<br>
There's no principles in what you say<br>
No direction in the things you do<br>
For your world is soon to come to a close<br>
Through the ages all great men have taught<br>
Truth and happiness just can't be bought - or sold<br>
Tell me why are you people so cold<br>
<br>
I'm....<br>
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow<br>
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow<br>
On Saturn<br>
People live to be two hundred and five<br>
Going back to Saturn where the people smile<br>
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly<br>
On Saturn<br>
Just to live to us is our natural high<br>
<br>
We have come here many times before<br>
To find your strategy to peace is war<br>
Killing helpless men, women and children<br>
That don't even know what they're dying for<br>
We can't trust you when you take a stand<br>
With a gun and bible in your hand<br>
And the cold expression on your face<br>
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy<br>
<br>
I'm....<br>
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow<br>
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow<br>
On Saturn<br>
People live to be two hundred and five<br>
Going back to Saturn where the people smile<br>
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly<br>
On Saturn<br>
Just to live to us is our natural high<br>

Lady love and lady cared<br>
but lady went away,<br>
And left me all alone to suffer.<br>
<br>
And now I feel it's not fair<br>
for me to fall in love<br>
The truth is the real me you must uncover.<br>
<br>
Seems so long, since I've heard the sound<br>
It's been so long, since I've trusted in someone else,<br>
Had to see it all for myself,<br>
It's been so long, that the world seems cold,<br>
But I think it's time in my life to find myself again.<br>
<br>
Lady loved and lady stayed,<br>
Until she was too pleased<br>
She knew I wouldn't leave for her to suffer.<br>
I'd never make her suffer.<br>
<br>
Now I believe you're just like me,<br>
In that you understand,<br>
And want me for your man to always love me.<br>
<br>
You can believe it's seems so long, since I've touched a wanting hand<br>
Oh, it seems so long, since I've trusted in someone else,<br>
Had to see this world for myself,<br>
And it's been so long that the world seems cold,<br>
Now I think I've found someone to make me trust in someone again.<br>
<br>
I believe that I can trust in you.<br>

Send her your love<br>
With a dozen roses<br>
Make sure that she knows it<br>
With a flower from your heart<br>
<br>
Show him your love<br>
Don't hold back your feelings<br>
You don't need a reason<br>
When it's straight from the heart<br>
<br>
I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more<br>
And people falling in love is so old fashioned<br>
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away<br>
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion<br>
<br>
Send her your love<br>
With a dozen roses<br>
Make sure that she knows it<br>
With a flower from your heart<br>
<br>
Show him your love<br>
Don't hold back your feelings<br>
You don't need a reason<br>
When it's straight from the heart<br>
<br>
I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal<br>
And can only happen in make believe stories<br>
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see<br>
For around us are miracles of love's glory<br>
<br>
Show him your love<br>
Don't hold back your feelings<br>
You don't need a reason<br>
When it's straight from the heart.<br>

<div align=left><font size="3" color=#CCFFFF>
I've seen you, I saw you, I see you<br>
without little notice, if any at all<br>
Of you knowing me watchin you<br>
You walking, you talking, you smiling<br>
You styling in everything your body wears<br>
And that's not just a point of view<br>
They're painting, they're ranting, they're raving<br>
About Miss Lovely got it going on<br>
From head down to her toes<br>
And no one knows better than I know<br>
Cause I've been listening to the spirit of<br>
Your body, mind and soul<br>
<br>
It's a sensuous whisper<br>
That makes my body weak<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That makes my psyche say<br>
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we<br>
<br>
Can feel you, can smell you, can taste you<br>
Though my senses never had the pleasure of<br>
That lovely wonderment<br>
But I start to shaking, I shiver, to think that little sparkle in your eye<br>
Means you are giving me some kind of hint<br>
I'm ready, I'm willing, I'm able<br>
In fact those words are at the tip of my tongue<br>
Eagerly waiting for me to say<br>
Then you smile and whisper "how are you?"<br>
But when I move my lips and try to speak the words just go away<br>
<br>
It's a sensuous whisper<br>
That makes my body weak<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That makes my psyche say<br>
Ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we<br>
<br>
It's that sensuous whisper that's got me trippin out<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That I don't wanna do without<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That makes me want to shout<br>
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we<br>
<br>
I don't even care how long it takes<br>
As long as I have you lying next to me<br>
Cause to wait forever and a day<br>
Is a small price to pay if it's you I'm getting<br>
If it's you I'm getting, I'm not quitting<br>
And that is how I'm living<br>
<br>
I'm clinging, not dreaming, but scheming<br>
With my nose against the grind and both my eyes focused upon the prize<br>
I think it, I trust it, I know it<br>
Your love that I've longed for is gonna be mine<br>
Good things do come in time<br>
I'm right on the rythm you're givin<br>
But this is more than giving up some casual mental telepathy<br>
The music, the candles, the champagne and all that's needed<br>
Is one thing to give it authenticity<br>
<br>
It's a sensuous whisper<br>
That makes my body weak<br>
It's that sensuous whisper That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That makes my psyche say<br>
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we<br>
<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That's got me trippin out<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That I don't wanna do without<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That makes me want to shout<br>
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we<br>
<br>
It's a sensuous whisper<br>
That makes my body rock<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That makes me beg baby don't ever stop<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That always get me hot, baby<br>
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we<br>
<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That makes me feel alright<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
That keep me wanting you morning, noon and every single night<br>
It's that sensuous whisper<br>
Don't want you out of my sight, baby<br>
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we<br>
<br>
It's that sensuous whisper (repetir)<br>

When the lights are down<br>
And the stage is bare<br>
And no more magic's in the air<br>
There's not a friend in sight to care<br>
Your tears no one will share<br>
I'll be your comfort through your pain<br>
I'll be your shelter in the rain<br>
<br>
When your sad is bad and your bad is worst<br>
And there's no who to turn to first<br>
When you've done everything you can<br>
No one's there to take your hand<br>
I'll be you comfort through your pain<br>
I'll be your shelter in the rain<br>
<br>
When you've looked around<br>
And haven't seen me anywhere<br>
Though when you were down<br>
I lifted you up from there<br>
There isn't a thing you can ask of me<br>
I won't do<br>
Just you put your trust in me<br>
My love will see you through<br>
<br>
When the final candle's flickered out<br>
"Why me" is all you can think about<br>
When all your joy has disappeared<br>
Your future isn't clear<br>
I'll be you comfort through your pain<br>
I'll be your shelter in the rain<br>
<br>
When all the odds say there's no chance<br>
Amidst the final dance<br>
I'll be you comfort through your pain<br>
I'll be your shelter in the rain<br>
I'll be you comfort through your pain<br>
Yes, I'll be your shelter in the rain, rain<br>
I'll be your shelter,<br>
Be your shelter, be your shelter in the rain<br>

City sidewalks<br>
Busy sidewalks<br>
Dressed in holiday style<br>
In the air there's a feeling like Christmas<br>
<br>
Children laughing<br>
People passing<br>
Meeting smile after smile<br>
And on every street corner you hear<br>
<br>
Silver bells, silver bells<br>
It's Christmas time in the city<br>
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing<br>
Soon it will be Christmas day<br>
<br>
Strings of street lights<br>
Even stop lights<br>
Blink a bright red and green<br>
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures<br>
<br>
Hear the snow crunch<br>
See the kids bunch<br>
This is Santa's big scene<br>
And above all this bustle you hear<br>

Silver bells, silver bells<br>
It's Christmas time in the city<br>
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing<br>

Music is a world within itself<br>
With a language we all understand<br>
With an equal opportunity<br>
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands<br>
But just because a record has a groove<br>
Don't make it in the groove<br>
But you can tell right away at letter A<br>
When the people start to move<br>
<br>
They can feel it all over<br>
They can feel it all over people<br>
They can feel it all over<br>
They can feel it all over people<br>
<br>
Music knows it is and always will<br>
Be one of the things that life just won't quit<br>
But here are some of music's pioneers<br>
That time will not allow us to forget<br>
For there's Basie, Miller, Schimo<br>
And the king of all Sir Duke<br>
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out<br>
There's no way the band can lose<br>
<br>
You can feel it all over<br>
You can feel it all over people<br>
You can feel it all over<br>
You can feel it all over people<br>

You can feel it all over<br>
You can feel it all over people<br>

You can feel it all over<br>
You can feel it all over people<br>
You can feel it all over<br>
You can feel it all over people<br>

You can feel it all over<br>

You can feel it all over<br>
Everybody-all over people<br>

Skeletons in your closet<br>
Itchin' to come outside<br>
Messin' with your conscience<br>
In a way your face can't hide<br>
<br>
Oh things are gettin' real funky<br>
Down at the old corral<br>
And it's not the skunks that are stinkin'<br>
It's the stinkin' lies you tell<br>
<br>
What did your mama tell you about lies<br>
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one<br>
What did your daddy tell you about lies<br>
He said one white one turns into a black one<br>
<br>
So, it's gettin' ready to blow<br>
It's gettin' ready to show<br>
Somebody shot off at the mouth and<br>
We're gettin' ready to know<br>
<br>
It's gettin' ready to drop<br>
It's gettin' ready to shock<br>
Somebody done turned up the heater<br>
An'a it's gettin' ready to pop<br>
<br>
Crevices in your pantry<br>
Now what do we have in here<br>
Havin' a daytime nightmare<br>
Has always been your biggest fear<br>
<br>
Oh things are gettin' real crucial<br>
Up the old wazoo<br>
Yet you cry, why am I the victim?<br>
When the culprit's y-o-u<br>
<br>
What did your mama tell you about lies<br>
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one<br>
What did your daddy tell you about lies<br>
He said one white one turns into a black one<br>
<br>
So, it's gettin' ready to blow<br>
It's gettin' ready to show<br>
Somebody shot off at the mouth and<br>
We're gettin' ready to know<br>

It's gettin' ready to drop<br>
It's gettin' ready to shock<br>
Somebody done turned up the heater<br>
An'a it's gettin' ready to pop<br>
<br>
It's gettin' ready to seep<br>
You're gettin' ready to freak<br>
Somebody done picked up the talk box<br>
We're gettin' ready to speak<br>
<br>
It's gettin' ready to jive<br>
You're gettin' ready to gel<br>
Somebody done gone let the lid off<br>
We're gettin' ready to smell<br>
<br>
They're gettin' ready to deal<br>
You're gettin' ready to ill<br>
Somebody done just dropped the big dime<br>
And they're gettin' ready to squeal<br>
<br>
It's gettin' ready to turn<br>
We're gettin' ready to learn<br>
Somebody done fired up the brimstone<br>
And you're gettin' ready to burn<br>
<br>
It's gettin' ready to shake<br>
You're gettin' ready to ache<br>
Somebody done snitched to the news crew<br>
And it's gettin' ready to break<br>
<br>
You're gettin' ready to lie<br>
They're gettin' ready to spy<br>
Somebody's been put on the hot seat<br>
And you're gettin' ready to fry<br>

If I'm caught at a dance party<br>
Without my dancin' shoes<br>
And everybody dances on my bare feet<br>
Shame on me<br>
<br>
If I'm mindin' my business<br>
Just doin the right thing<br>
And you try to front me off in the street<br>
Shame on you<br>
<br>
If a family's waiting for that<br>
Special blessing to come their way<br>
But they ain't tryin' to get on<br>
Their knees and pray<br>
Shame on them<br>
<br>
And if we live in a time where<br>
every nation's fightin' 'round the world<br>
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way<br>
Shame on us<br>
<br>
Shame on me,<br>
Shame on you,<br>
Shame on them,<br>
Shame on us<br>

So what the fuss<br>
<br>
If I gotta get up early in the morning<br>
For a job interview<br>
And I forget to set the stupid alarm<br>
Shame on me<br>
<br>
If my children are playin' outside<br>
Like little children do<br>
And you come 'round there<br>
Trying to bring them some harm<br>
Shame on you<br>
<br>
Should I be drivin' thru a klantown<br>
Find a restaurant to get me some food<br>
And someone says "hey boy, we don't serve your kind"<br>
Shame on them<br>
<br>
And if we live in a democracy<br>
And you don't use your power to vote<br>
Knowin' some would like to turn back the hands of time<br>
<br>
Shame on me,<br>
Shame on you,<br>
Shame on them,<br>
Shame on us<br>

So what the fuss<br>
<br>
If I'm hooked on a habit<br>
Knowin damn well it could cost me my life<br>
Yet I keep doin what I should do without<br>
Shame on me<br>
<br>
If you're locked in a marriage<br>
And your other half just gives you abuse<br>
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out<br>
Shame on you<br>
<br>
If we're jammin' the music<br>
And somebody's got the audacity<br>
To say that they can jam it better than us<br>
Shame on them<br>

And should there be just a handful that believe<br>
That we are totally free<br>
And there's no need to fight for equality<br>

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys<br>
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys<br>
One warm December our hearts will see<br>
A world where men are free<br>
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars<br>
When we have learned what Christmas is for<br>
When we have found what life's really worth<br>
There'll be peace on earth<br>
Someday all our dreams will come to be<br>
Someday in a world where men are free<br>
Maybe not in time for you and me<br>
But someday at Christmastime<br>
Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man<br>
No hungry children, no empty hand<br>
One happy morning people will share<br>
Our world where people care<br>
<br>
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears<br>
All men are equal and no men have fears<br>
One shinning moment my heart ran away<br>
From our world today<br>
<br>
Someday all our dreams will come to be<br>
Someday in a world where men are free<br>
Maybe not in time for you and me<br>
But someday at Christmastime<br>
<br>
Someday at Christmas man will not fail<br>
Take hope because your love will prevail<br>
Someday a new world that we can start<br>
With hope in every heart<br>
<br>
Someday all our dreams will come to be<br>
Someday in a world where men are free<br>
Maybe not in time for you and me<br>

Something Out Of The Blue<br>
I opened up my mind<br>
Peace I could not find<br>
Then something out of the blue<br>
Said I needed you<br>
Time swept me away<br>
Merged me into pain<br>
Then something out of the blue<br>
Said you need me too<br>
Oh what joy it bring to me<br>
To know that heavens round<br>
Oh what gladness in my heart<br>
To know my love's been found<br>
Now where hope was lost<br>
Love's paid the cost<br>
And something out of the blue<br>
Said my love is you<br>
Something out of the blue<br>
Said I needed you<br>
Something out of the blue<br>

Into each life there comes a time<br>
When you must pay your lovers' dues<br>
Breakin' out in a cold sweat<br>
Cause you've been rightfully accused<br>
<br>
I'm not such a strong man<br>
That love can't make me weak<br>
You're walkin' out the door<br>
And it's hurting me so deep, so deep<br>
<br>
And I'm sorry<br>
Sorry that I made you cry<br>
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies<br>
I'm sorry, sorry the way we fuss and fight<br>
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're<br>
saying goodbye to me<br>
<br>
Every young boy will grow up<br>
To then become a man<br>
Then the difference from wrong and right<br>
He clearly understands<br>
I'm not such a big man<br>
That I can't break down in tears<br>
Cause my whole body went into shock<br>
When you told me you were out of here! Out of here!<br>
<br>
And I'm sorry<br>
Sorry that I made you cry<br>
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies<br>
I'm sorry, sorry the way we fuss and fight<br>
I'm sorry, sorry cause now you're saying<br>

I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you<br>
I'm sorry baby, that I ever made you cry<br>
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you<br>
I'm sorry baby, that I ever told you lies<br>
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you<br>
I'm sorry baby, sorry the way we fuss and fight<br>
I'm sorry baby, that I ever did it to you<br>
I'm sorry baby, so sorry<br>
<br>
If you added up all the good times<br>
And compared them with the bad<br>
You'd realize that our love<br>
Was the best you ever had<br>
<br>
I'm not such a proud man<br>
That I won't cop a plea<br>
See me baby girl, I'm on my knees<br>
Beggin please, baby please, baby please, oh yeah<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, sorry that I made you cry<br>
Sorry, sorry that I told you lies<br>

They knock on your door<br>
You laugh in their face<br>
They tell you it's time to pray<br>
They give you a book<br>
And tell you to read<br>
And point to the Judgment Day<br>
<br>
People say they live dangerously<br>
Walking places they should not be<br>
But they will walk their lives<br>
With a never ending light<br>
They will walk their lives<br>
'til they shine the light<br>
Of truth into your life<br>
<br>
They sit on a stump<br>
You run from their sight<br>
To not hear the holy word<br>
They sing and they chant<br>
They preach and they speak<br>
In tongues you have never heard<br>
<br>
But people say they live dangerously<br>
Walking places they should not be<br>
But they will walk their lives<br>
With a never ending light<br>
They will walk their lives<br>
'til they shine the light<br>
Of truth into your life<br>
<br>
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers<br>
They just walk the light through the day through the night<br>
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers<br>
They just walk the light through the day through the night<br>
Walk on ...<br>
<br>
On corners of streets<br>
And airports of tents<br>
They reach out for you to come in<br>
They have no defense<br>
Except inner sense<br>
And knowing the Almighty Friend<br>
<br>
People say they live dangerously<br>
Walking places they should not be<br>
But they will walk their lives<br>
With a never ending light<br>
They will walk their lives<br>

Of truth into your life … truth into your life<br>

Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers<br>

Come on and shine that light through the day through the night<br>
Haven't you ever encountered the spiritual walkers<br>
They just walk the light through the day through the night<br>
Even though when they knock on your door<br>
You laugh in their face<br>
You run from their sight<br>
Not to hear the holy word<br>
They have no defense<br>

Haven't you<br>

Seize upon that moment long ago<br>
One breath away and there you will be<br>
So young and carefree<br>
Again you will see<br>
That place in time...so gold<br>
<br>
Steal away into that way back when<br>
You thought that all would last forever<br>
But like the weather<br>
Nothing can ever...and be in time<br>
Stay gold<br>
<br>
But can it be<br>
When we can see<br>
So vividly<br>
A memory<br>
And yes you say<br>
So must the day<br>
Too, fade away<br>
And leave a ray of sun<br>
So gold<br>
<br>
Life is but a twinkling of an eye<br>
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion<br>
Though not imagined<br>
All things that happen<br>
Will age too old<br>
Though gold<br>

The curtain goes up<br>
The first act begins<br>
The scene is two people in love<br>
Lovely is she, lucky feels he<br>
<br>
She smiles in his eyes<br>
He smiles in her eyes<br>
They both vow love never to part<br>
One sight for all, lovers to see<br>
<br>
A perfect love story begins<br>
'til insecurity sets in<br>
what happens then is, one aching heart<br>
Oh, I don't wanna be<br>
No stranger on the shore of love with tears<br>
And a broken heart<br>
I can tell you that I don't wanna be<br>
No stranger on the shore of love with tears<br>
And a broken heart<br>
<br>
A table for two<br>
Love vows of " I do "<br>
A honeymoon out of a dream<br>
Who could ask for, anything more<br>
<br>
A home on a hill<br>
With love daffodils<br>
And cold winter nights by the fire<br>
What more could be, for she and he<br>
<br>
There's more than enough love and yet<br>
She or he starts feeling regret<br>
What do you get, one broken heart<br>
<br>
Oh, I don't wanna be<br>
No stranger on the shore of love with tears<br>
And a broken heart<br>
I can tell you from experience I don't wanna be<br>
No stranger on the shore of love with tears<br>
And a broken heart<br>
I don't wanna be<br>
No stranger on the shore of love with tears<br>
And a-a-a-oh, oh, oh<br>
Oh, I don't wanna be, please don't let me be<br>
No stranger on the shore of love with tears<br>
And a broken heart, na, na, na, na, na<br>
I don't wanna be no, don't let me be no<br>
No, no, no with tears<br>
I don't wanna have an upset stomach from a broken heart, baby<br>
I don't wanna be<br>
No stranger on the shore of love with tears<br>
And a broken heart<br>

Summer soft ....<br>
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off<br>
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus<br>
She brings gifts through her breeze<br>
<br>
Morning rain ....<br>
Gently plays her rhythmns on your window pane<br>
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change<br>
To bring rain or sunshine<br>
<br>
And so you wait to see what she'll do<br>
Is it sun or rain for you<br>
But it breaks your heart in two<br>
When you find it's October<br>
And she's gone<br>
And she's gone<br>
Summer's gone<br>
Taking with her summer's play<br>
<br>
Winter wind....<br>
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend<br>
But not waiting for your answer he begins<br>
Forcing dangers way with his breeze<br>
<br>
Morning snow...<br>
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw<br>
But just where or when he never lets you know<br>
If it's snow or clear days you'll find<br>
<br>
And so you wait to see what he'll do<br>
Is it sun or rain for you<br>
But it breaks your heart in two<br>
Cause you've been fooled by April<br>
And he's gone<br>
And he's gone<br>
Winter's gone<br>
<br>
You find it's October<br>
And she's gone<br>
And she's gone<br>
Summer's gone<br>
<br>
You've been fooled by April<br>
And he's gone<br>
And he's gone<br>
Winter's gone<br>

You find it's October<br>
And she's gone<br>
And she's gone<br>
Summer's gone<br>

You've been fooled by April<br>

A barren pain<br>
 A dream unchased<br>
 Oh I can't wait untill the day there's sunshine in their eyes<br>
<br>
 A prayer is heard<br>
 By one so small<br>
 Let love be in the<br>
 Hearts of all<br>
 Oh I can't wait untill there's sunshine in their eyes<br>
<br>
 You and I may never see them cry<br>
 Or wonder why the world's so cold<br>
 You feel that they're too young<br>
 To take a look around<br>
 But in their faces I can see the trouble all around<br>
<br>
 Today we must turn into lies<br>
 The truth already in their minds<br>
 Oh I can't wait untill the day there's sunshine in their eyes<br>
<br>
 He can't wait untill the day there's sunshine in their eyes<br>
 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sunshine<br>
 Oh I can't wait untill the day there's sunshine in their eyes<br>
 Sunshine in our eyes<br>

When the summer came you were not around<br>
Now the summer's gone and love cannot be found<br>
Where were you when I needed you-last winter, my love?<br>
<br>
When the winter came you went further south<br>
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt<br>
Where are you when I need you, like right now?<br>
<br>
Our love is at an end<br>
But you say now you have changed<br>
But tomorrow will reflect love's past<br>
<br>
When the winter came you were not around<br>
Through the bitter winds love could not be found<br>
Where were you when I needed you, last winter, my love?<br>

<br>
Our love is at an end<br>
But you say now you have changed,<br>

Well is it summer love that will let me down,<br>

Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go<br>

On the beach I build a castle<br>
Out of loneliness and sand<br>
I'm the saddest boy I know<br>
Just had to build me a wonderland<br>
'Cause when you came by hand in hand<br>
With another guy<br>
I just could not stop those big tears<br>
Falling from my eyes<br>
<br>
The high tides coming in<br>
Oh no no I can't stand to see my kingdom end<br>
The boys laughed at me and said<br>
Oh sad boy never be lovers by the sand<br>
<br>
The tide came rushing in<br>
Took my poor castle out to the sea<br>
If the ocean be that strong<br>
Well then that'a where I wanna be<br>
<br>
When she reads in the paper<br>
That this same sad boy has drowned<br>
Will she laugh with him<br>
And say "That funny clown".<br>

Smile and maybe tomorrow<br>
You'll see the sun come shining through for you<br>
<br>
Light up your face with gladness<br>
Hide every trace of sadness<br>
Although a tear may be ever so near<br>
That's the time you must keep on trying<br>
Smile, what's the use of crying?<br>
You'll find that life is still worthwhile<br>

Once upon the blood of many<br>
We were cast as less than many<br>
To so much a point some still believe<br>
Smaller seemed a world much bigger<br>
Where it?s ok to play with the word ?Nigger?<br>
Yet would we knowing all the grief and death it breeds<br>
<br>
But that was some years ago<br>
When we had more hope than money<br>
A time in a world ago<br>
When our hearts were made of steel<br>
Back then it was all about<br>
Stamping all the hatred out<br>
So that now there would be no doubt<br>
We wouldn?t know to deal<br>
<br>
But why if so long ago<br>
We?re seen safe only when funny<br>
As if there?s no need to show<br>
Deep inside what we really feel<br>
Yet those things when brought to view<br>
Seem to bother but a few<br>
No! If we don?t come for real<br>
Our wounds won?t heal<br>
<br>
Black Silhouettes used as target practice<br>
There?s darkie toothpaste born out of this malice<br>
These stereo typical images comes to mind<br>
There?s figurines, mascots, postcards of us hanging<br>
Most recently hear of one of us dragging<br>
The propaganda machine must tell the truth this time, stop lying<br>

Trial and error true.<br>
Oh, if you were to come down there,<br>
You would love her too! like I do!<br>
<br>
She's so beautiful.<br>
She's so kind and free! yeah!<br>
She's so beautiful.<br>
She's all there is to me.<br>
(repeat 7 times)<br>
