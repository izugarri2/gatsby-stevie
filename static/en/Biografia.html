		  The son of a Protestant pastor and a fighting mother, Steveland Morris (Stevie Wonder) was born on May 13, 1950. Third in a family of 6 children and blind as a result of wanting to come into the world 6 weeks earlier, which cause the blood vessels in the back of his eyes have not formed, and their retinas are lost. Retinopathy of prematurity or ROP is the medical term, which was not helped by the excess oxygen pumped into his incubator.
		  <br><br>
		  His blindness forced him to change his way of communicating with the world, replacing the forms for notes, the light
            for the melodies and the outlines for rhythms, creating a musical full world of tones. His parents, when little Stevie was 5 years old, separated and moved with his mother and 5 brothers to Detroit, where they survive not without great efforts. His voice - out of the ordinary- causes his mother to enter the choir of the church; Is his first contact with the music. </div>

        <div class="row">

          </div>
          <div class="grid_10"> But his soul full of rhythm and swing did that it was not late in meeting others "black child" of the parish, continuing the steps of "The Miracles" and other groups of Rythm and Blues or Jazz, devoting itself to do small shows in the streets of the quarter. There were 5 devilish creatures moving with a few frantic rhythms and interpreting a pagan music. <br>
            <br>
            This did that a feligresa was denouncing such an "aberration" and interrupted momentarily the musical beginning of Stevie, who had to be content to hear music in his favorite program of radio, <font color="#00FFFF">sundown</font> and to dream with have a piano. The luck, in this case smiled him at the child Stevie, and did that a charity organization it was giving him a drums, which although it was not the dreamed piano, served him to start creating rhythms. It begins to touch with more frequency and takes part in a group with a cousin of his, the one who provides to him an audition for the record company <font color="#00FFFF">Tamla-Motown</font>, where it is immediately hired on having remained bewildered with this child of 11 years old. </div>

          <div class="grid_8"> At that age of 11 year old everyone called him "Little", but the fledgling Motown record house -created by blacks to produce black music in a hostile white environment- had given him the nickname "the boy Wonder", alluding to the word "wonderboy", child prodigy. But one fine day he renamed himself <font color="#00FFFF">Little Stevie Wonder</font>.
		  <br><br>
		  <font color="#00FFFF">The Motown</font> launches him and will not take long to reach his first hit -"<a href="Canciones/Fingertips.html">Fingertips</a>"- a dance song recorded in live that makes him get his first gold record and make him a little star. Both the single and the album, <a href="1963-the12years.html">The 12 Year Old Genius Live</a>, reach the undisputed number one on the major charts. At this age, 13, Stevie is already a musician and perfect composer beginning to rub shoulders with greats as <a href="Marvin-Gaye.html">Marvin Gaye</a>.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
                   <div class="grid_8"><br>
            The years go and decides deleted the "little" from his stage name, and start recording a series of albums produced by <font color="#00FFFF">Clarence Paul</font>. His voice was changing to him. He grew a mustache and hoped that the concerts will throw the girls phone numbers. <br>
            <br>
            His mother worried that the music does not neglect his studies and hired a private tutor to travel with him at that time he had to make some tour. His name was Ted Hull, a graduate of Michigan State University. Together Clarence Paul and Ardena Johnson, an employee of the Motown, they assumed the role of tutor. 
        <br><br>
            The successes at this time did not give back, and despite the work that had trouble eliminating the tagline of "little Stevie" emerged great songs as "<a href="Canciones/Uptight.html">Uptight</a>", "<a href="Canciones/I-Was-Made.html">I Was Made To Love Her</a>", "<a href="Canciones/For-Once-In-My-Life.html">For once in my life</a>", "<a href="Canciones/My-Cherie-Amour.html">My cherie amour</a>", "<a href="Canciones/Shoo-be-doo.html">Shoo-be- doo-be-doo-da-day</a>", or "<a href="Canciones/Yester-Me.html">Yester-me, yester-you, yester-day</a>". All of them reached the top ten, and helped make Stevie one of the most successful artists.<br>
            <br>
            Stevie's compositions which demonstrate a talent and innate qualities of the great composer that exploded in a brutal manner in the next decade, breaking all molds known so far.
