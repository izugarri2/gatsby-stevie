One little Christmas tree was standing alone<br>
Waiting for someone to come by<br>
One little Christmas tree that never had grown<br>
Cried as he looked up to the sky<br>
<br>
Oh please Mr Father tree, the tallest of all<br>
I'm so afraid and alone<br>
Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small<br>
Light up someone's home 'cause<br>
<br>
One little Christmas tree can light up a home<br>
So one little child can find a toy<br>
One little Christmas tree can light up a home<br>
So one little heart can find some joy<br>
<br>
One little angel who was riding a star<br>
Cried as she looked down at the tree<br>
Oh please Mr Father tree wherever you are<br>
May I give him the star you gave to me<br>
<br>
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar<br>
A voice that was heard throughout the world<br>
Go down little angel girl and give him your star<br>
Tonight he'll light the world 'cause<br>
<br>
One little Christmas tree can light up the world<br>
So those who are lost may find their way<br>
One little Christmas tree can light up the world<br>
So all men may see you on Christmas Day<br>

There we were two lonely souls<br>
Existing from day to day
Feeling love would never<br>
Come our way<br>
<br>
Watching lovers share their bliss<br>
Sadly wishing only if<br>
Believing that we had to live<br>
Life like this<br>
<br>
But like a bolt of lightning<br>
As when two stormy clouds collide<br>
We made a joyful happening<br>
To our lives<br>
<br>
Now we're happy as can be<br>
Me loving you and you loving me<br>
Two hearts intertwined<br>
Wich makes us one of a kind<br>
<br>
Feeling the charge of a love evermore<br>
Knowing that love is enough to live for<br>
It feels so fine<br>
Sharing love one of a kind<br>
<br>
One of a kind now baby<br>
Your love and mine<br>
One of a kind, sweet darling<br>
The only way love is meant to be<br>
<br>
United love so fine<br>
Living in love one of a kind<br>
It feels nothing but fine<br>
Sharing our love one of a kind<br>
<br>
If we had a second chance<br>
At living a second time<br>
We'd change everything but our love<br>
In our lives<br>
<br>
'Cause like a big disaster<br>
Lost in a never-ending night<br>
We light a light of magic<br>
Made everything right<br>
<br>
Now we're happy as can be<br>
Me loving you and you loving me<br>
Two hearts intertwined<br>
Wich makes us one of a kind<br>
<br>
Feeling the charge of a love evermore<br>
Knowing that love is enough to live for<br>
It feels so fine<br>
Sharing love one of a kind<br>
<br>
One of a kind, now baby<br>
Your love and mine, such ecstasy<br>
One of a kind, sweet darling<br>
The only way love is meant to be<br>

<div align=left><font size="3" color=#CCFFFF>

When by the phone<br>
In vain you sit<br>
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just<br>
An ordinary pain in your heart<br>
<br>
When you by chance<br>
Go knock on her door<br>
Walkin' away you're convinced that it's much more<br>
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart<br>
It's more than just<br>
An ordinary pain in your heart<br>
<br>
When you catch up<br>
But she says goodbye<br>
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry<br>
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart<br>
<br>
Tell her you're glad<br>
It's over in fact<br>
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back<br>
Takin that ordinary pain from your heart<br>
It's more than just<br>
An ordinary pain from your heart<br>
<br>
Don't fool yourself<br>
But tell no one else<br>
That it's more than just<br>
An ordinary pain<br>
In your heart<br>
In your heart<br>
In your heart<br>
<br>
PARTE II<br>
<br>
You're just a masachistic fool<br>
Because you knew my love was cruel<br>
You never listened when they said<br>
Don't let that girl go to your head<br>
But like a play boy you said no<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
This little girl mind you will blow<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
But then I blew you out the box<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
When I put my stuff on key and lock<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
It makes me feel kind of sick<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
To know love put you in a trick<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
I knew our love would have to end<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
The day I made it with your friend<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
Giving your love to one unreal<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
Like a big fool I know you feel<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
But in this lovie-dovie game<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
With all its joy there must be pain<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
But now the time has surely come<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
This game don't seem like so much fun<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
You're cryin big corcodile tears<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
Don't match the ones I've cried for years<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
When I was home wainting for you<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
You were out somewhere doing the do<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
You know I'd really like to stay<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
But like you did I've go to play<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
You're dumb to think I'd let you be<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
Scott free without some pain from me<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
I heard your song and took a chance<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
But to your music I can't dance
or*di*nary pain<br>
Go tell your story 'sob-sad'<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
About you blowin what you had<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
Since one ain't good enough for you<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
Then do yourself see how you do<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>
or*di*nary pain<br>

Much has been written about<br>
The world and all its kind of loves<br>
But the sweetest of them all<br>
You seldom will find stories of, oh oh oh oh<br>

My love lives outside my window<br>
Clouds burst to give water<br>
So her love can grow, oh<br>
My love smiles to me each morning<br>
Says she'll never leave me and I know it's so<br>

Describing another's prettiness<br>
But if ever there was choice<br>
My flower would be the prettiest, oh oh oh oh<br>

Clouds burst to give water<br>
So her love can grow, oh<br>
My love smiles to me each morning<br>

Over time, I've building my castle of love<br>
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason<br>
I've gone much too far for you now to say<br>
That I've got to throw my castle away<br>
<br>
Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true<br>
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming<br>
The sandman has come from too far away<br>
For you to say come back some other day<br>
<br>
And though you don't believe that they do<br>
They do come true<br>
For did my dreams<br>
Come true when I looked at you<br>
And maybe too, if you would believe<br>
You too might be<br>
Overjoyed, over loved, over me<br>
<br>
Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone<br>
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover<br>
I've come much too far for me now to find<br>
The love that I've sought can never be mine<br>
<br>
And though you don't believe that they do<br>
They do come true<br>
For did my dreams<br>
Come true when I looked at you<br>
And maybe too, if you would believe<br>
You too might be<br>
Overjoyed, over loved, over me<br>
<br>
And though the odds say improbable<br>
What do they know<br>
For in romance<br>
All true love needs is a chance<br>
And maybe with a chance you will find<br>
You too like I<br>
Overjoyed, over loved, over you, over you<br>

Grab your coat and get your hat<br>
Leave your worries on the doorstep<br>
Life can be so sweet<br>
On the sunny side of the street<br>
<br>
Can't you hear the pitter-pat<br>
And that happy tune is your step<br>
Life can be complete<br>
On the sunny side of the street<br>
<br>
I used to walk in the shade with my blues on parade<br>
But I'm not afraid...this rover's crossed over<br>
<br>
If I never had a cent<br>
I'd be rich as Rockefeller<br>
Gold dust at my feet<br>
On the sunny side of the street<br>
<br>
[Instrumental break]<br>
<br>
I used to walk in the shade with them blues on parade<br>
Now I'm not afraid... this rover has crossed over<br>
<br>
Now if I never made one cent<br>
I'll still be rich as Rockefeller<br>
There will be goldust at my feet<br>
On the sunny<br>
On the sunny, sunny side of the street<br>

Everyone knows him as "old folks"<br>
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go<br>
Just as free as a bird, and as good as his word<br>
That's why everybody loves him so<br>
<br>
Always leaving his spoon in his coffee<br>
Puts his napkin under his chin<br>
And that yellow corn pipe,<br>
It's so mellow, it's right<br>
You needn't be ashamed of him<br>
<br>
Every friday he'll go fishin'<br>
Way down on buzzard's bay<br>
But he only hooks a perch or two<br>
"A whale got away..."<br>
So so we warm up the steak, yeah<br>
<br>
Someday there'll be no more old folks<br>
What a lonely old world this'll be<br>
Children's voices at play<br>
Will be still for a day<br>
The day they take old folks away<br>

Call up, ring once, hang up the phone<br>
To let me know you made it home<br>
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover<br>
If she's with me I'll blink the lights<br>
To let you know tonight's the night<br>
For me and you my part-time lover<br>
<br>
We are undercover passion on the run<br>
Chasing love up against the sun<br>
We are strangers by day, lovers by night<br>
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right<br>
<br>
If I'm with friends and we should meet<br>
Just pass me by, don't even speak<br>
Know the word's "discreet" when part-time lovers<br>
But if there's some emergency<br>
Have a male friend to ask for me<br>
So then she won't peek its really you my part-time lover<br>
<br>
We are undercover passion on the run<br>
Chasing love up against the sun<br>
We are strangers by day, lovers by night<br>
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right<br>
(Repetir)<br>
<br>
I've got something that I must tell<br>
Last night someone rang our doorbell<br>
And it was not you my part-time lover<br>
And then a man called our exchange<br>
But didn't want to leave his name<br>
I guess that two can play the game<br>
Of part-time lovers<br>
You and me, part-time lovers<br>
But, she and he, part-time lovers <br>

The day's been hot and sunny<br>
Evening's about to take control<br>
The sky is painting pictures<br>
Stirring up love bliss in our souls<br>
The breeze carries the fragrance<br>
Of the sweetest symphony as it blows through your hair<br>
Better can be nowhere<br>
<br>
Our voices turn to whispers<br>
Blending with rhythms of the night<br>
The nightingales sing a love song<br>
Glancing down at us in their flight<br>
The moisture brings forth magic<br>
That permeates the midnight air<br>
To kiss the love we share, are<br>
<br>
Raindrops, passionate raindrops<br>
The kind of rain that writes they're<br>
So in love on our skin<br>
Raindrops, that we hope wont stop<br>
Cooling the red hot love that we are making<br>
<br>
Raindrops, passionate raindrops<br>
That brings out all the fire that we have within<br>
Raindrops cover every spot<br>
Right to the last drop<br>
We want all of you and then<br>
Let each drop a rain be a lifetime that our love won't end<br>
<br>
Somewhere in our doing<br>
Trying to make our bodies one<br>
We fall prey to moon dreams<br>
Till awaken by the morning sun<br>
Still disorientated<br>
I feel something warm on my face<br>
Coupled by your embrace<br>
We gaze in awe and wonder<br>
As if we can't believe it's so<br>
Just that taste of heaven<br>
Has got us longing for much more<br>
We lie there impatient<br>
Anxiously waiting foe the sun to go in<br>
And the clouds to burst again, to give us
<br>
Raindrops, passionate raindrops<br>
The kind of rain that writes they're<br>
So in love on our skin<br>
Raindrops, that we hope wont stop<br>
Cooling the red hot love that we are making<br>
<br>
Raindrops, passionate raindrops<br>
That brings out all the fire that we have within<br>
Raindrops cover every spot<br>
Right to the last drop<br>
We want all of you and then<br>
Let each drop a rain be a lifetime that our love won't end<br>

Some people ask me why always on the bright side<br>
When there's so much going on down the other side<br>
It's like I live in a bubble with no trouble<br>
And problems don't exist<br>
<br>
I chuckle and tell them that ain't the case at all<br>
It goes way back to the time when I was very small<br>
Not in mind but size and age my papa use to say<br>
<br>
You can always look at the negative<br>
But you should always live in the positive<br>
So I try everyday to live that way<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
Some people live in what was and what they could have been<br>
As opposed to living in a what is and how much they can<br>
And be the first to complain about nothing in life going their way<br>
The attitude is "that I can't do nothing 'bout"<br>
And very happy with just breathing in and out<br>
The ones that when you say "lets go make a difference"<br>
They'll say "naw that's OK"<br>
<br>
So I don't waste time on the trip side<br>
'Cause I do know the real on the flipside<br>
And I'm crystal clear everyday that's why I say, yeah<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
When I see the morning<br>
And the sun is smiling down upon me<br>
I joy in the blessing<br>
That still the ground is not above me<br>
And for the people<br>
That I can truly say do love me, I feel<br>
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be<br>
Positivity, 'cause this day did not have to be<br>
<br>
Some ask me why I'm such an optimist<br>
When it's more fashionable be a pessimist<br>
From what's in seventy-five percent of what we read, hear and view<br>
Well I use to have a friend named Minnie Riperton<br>
Who use to always say when she was living<br>
"Like fine wine I like seeing the glass of life as half full than half empty"<br>
<br>
I'm saying sometimes life can't be rough<br>
But never to the point of me saying I've had enough<br>
Long as my heart beats I ain't giving up<br>
That's why I say everyday<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
When people ask me as an African American<br>
What do I see for tomorrow in the human plan?<br>
Is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?<br>
<br>
I say unity is only as big as our vision<br>
And if its narrow, try to expand beyond the horizon<br>
But true leaders must guide us through the ills of society<br>
That stands in our way<br>
So if the road is to harmony, be with the call<br>
But if its about discord, don't take the ride at all<br>
'Cause the world vision I see is the one-we for everybody<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
When I see the morning<br>
And the sun is smiling down upon me<br>
Just joy in the blessing<br>
That still the ground is not above me<br>
And for the people<br>
That you can truly say do love you, do feel<br>
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be<br>
Positivity, and that's the energy the world needs<br>
Positivity, 'cause that's what life means to me<br>
Positivity, 'cause this day did not have to be<br>
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be<br>
Positivity, 'cause that's the energy the world needs<br>
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be<br>
Positivity, and this day did not have to be<br>
Positivity, 'cause that's what life means to me<br>
Positivity, and that's the energy the world needs<br>
Positivity, 'cause that's what life's meant to be<br>

Pick out a pleasant outlook<br>
Stick out that noble chin<br>
Wipe off that "full of doubt" look<br>
Slap on a happy grin!<br>
<br>
And spread sunshine all over the place,<br>
Just put on a happy face!<br>
Put on a happy face<br>

Don't sit and whine<br>

She'd never laugh or sing<br>
She wouldn't listen to me<br>

Excuse me please your majesty<br>
I chance this moment nervously<br>
To share with you a fantasy<br>
That I have lived inside of me<br>

And it is so pretty<br>
And it is so fine<br>
Its the kind you'd love to last you<br>
Until the end of time<br>
<br>
We've talked of love, we've talked of life<br>
And what would make the world so nice<br>
We've walked the sand by lover's sea<br>
I've held your body close to me<br>
<br>
And it is so pretty<br>
How I'd love to know<br>
For if I had a chance to hold you<br>
I'd never let you go<br>

There's not a day that passes by<br>
That I don't have you on my mind<br>
If this ain't love I have inside<br>
Then my heart's telling me a lie<br>
Cause it feels so special<br>
And it feels so right<br>
And if I could I know I'd love you<br>
For the rest of my life<br>

Such a lovely world was made for you and me<br>
Wondrous life for us to taste, touch, smell, hear, and see<br>
But one glance from outside looking at our world state<br>
Clearly displays we don't appreciate it at all<br>
Rain your love down won't you rain down your love<br>
Let it drench us like the sun from above<br>
Such ability inside you and me<br>
Made to do anything and be all we can be<br>
But one bird's eye view at us does show, oh it shows<br>
That against God's Plan we've let it go, oh no<br>
Rain your love down won't you rain down your love<br>
Let it drench us like the sun from above<br>
Rain your love down let it rain down today<br>
So that it may wash all our sins away<br>
You'd think the signs would make a difference,<br>
oh, make a difference<br>
You'd think fire next time instead of rain<br>
Would cause us to make a change<br>
The world has gone insane<br>
Rain, rain your love down won't you rain down your love<br>
Let it drench us like the sun from above<br>
Rain your love down let it rain down today<br>
So that it may wash all our sins away, let it rain<br>
Rain your love down let it pour on us, please<br>
Cleansing us from hunger, hate, war, and greed<br>
Rain your love down, won't you let it start over again<br>
So we can live up to your Master Plan<br>
Rain your love down oh won't you let it start<br>
Wash the wicked minds and the...<br>
I know they're sick, you know they're sick, we know they're sick at heart, yeah<br>
Rain your love down won't you let it rain<br>
Rid this world of drugs, disease, crime, and pain<br>
Clear our spirits give our minds new software<br>
With your lesson on honor, respect, trust, and care<br>
Rain your love down I beg for human sake<br>
For only you can get us out of this state<br>
Rain your love down rain down on all mankind<br>
Cause we are out of order and so out of line.<br>

We cant lose with God on our side<br>
Well find strength in each tear we cry<br>

Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do<br>
Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do-oo<br>
<br>
I longed for you since I was born<br>
A woman sensitive and warm<br>
And that you were<br>
<br>
With pride and strength no one would test<br>
But yet have feminie finesse<br>
And so much more<br>
<br>
You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to this cold, cold world<br>
Took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to this cold, cold world<br>
<br>
A female Shakespeare of your time<br>
With looks to blow Picasso's mind<br>
You were the best<br>
<br>
Your body moved with grace and song<br>
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms<br>
Nevertheless, oh oh<br>
<br>
You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to this cold, cold world<br>
Ooh you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to this cold, cold world<br>
<br>
Da Da Da, Da Da Da, Da Da Da, Da Da Da<br>
Da Da Da, Da Da Da-aa<br>
<br>
The passion burning in your heart<br>
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark<br>
Where did it go<br>
<br>
Just why that you would overnight<br>
Turn love to stone as cold as ice<br>
I'll never know<br>
<br>
But you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to this cold, cold world<br>
Baby you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to this cold, cold world<br>
<br>
Cold, too cold, you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to this cold, cold world<br>
Oh, Oh, Oh, took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to into this cold, cold world<br>
<br>
I would not do that to a dog<br>
Took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to this cold, cold world<br>
you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star<br>
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back<br>
down to this cold, cold world<br>
Ooh baby<br>
Rocket love<br>

Red sails in the sunset,<br>
Way out on the sea.<br>
Oh carry my loved one,<br>
Home safely to me.<br>
<br>
He sailed at the dawning,<br>
All day I've been blue.<br>
Red sails in the sunset,<br>
I'm trusting in you.<br>
<br>
Swift wings you must borrow.<br>
Make straight for the shore.<br>
We marry tomorrow,<br>
And he goes sailing no more.<br>
<br>
Red sails in the sunset<br>
Wayout on the sea.<br>
Oh carry my loved one,<br>
Home safely to me. <br>

Old pirates, yes, they rob I;<br>
Sold I to the merchant ships--<br>
Minutes after they took I<br>
From the bottomless pit.<br>
But my hand was made strong<br>
By the 'and of the Almighty.<br>
We fought in this generation<br>
Triumphantly.<br>
Won't you help to sing<br>
These songs of freedom? --<br>
'Cause all I ever have:<br>
Redemption songs<br>
Redemption songs.<br>
<br>
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery;<br>
None but ourselves can free our minds.<br>
Have no fear for atomic energy,<br>
'Cause none of them can stop the time.<br>
How long shall they kill our prophets,<br>
While we stand aside and look? Oooh!<br>
Some say it's just a part of it:<br>
We've got to fulfill the book.<br>
<br>
Won't you help to sing<br>
These songs of freedom? -<br>
'Cause all I ever have:<br>
Redemption song<br>
Redemption song<br>
Redemption song.<br>
<br>
EMANCIPATE yourselves from mental slavery;<br>
None but ourselves can free our mind.<br>
WoAH! Have no fear for atomic energy,<br>
'Cause none of them-a can-a stop-a the time.<br>
How long shall they kill our prophets,<br>
While we stand aside and look?<br>
Yes, some say it's just a part of it:<br>
We've got to fulfill the book.<br>
Won't you help to sing<br>
These songs of freedom? --<br>
'Cause all I ever had:<br>
Redemption songs --<br>
All I ever had:<br>
Redemption songs...<br>
These songs of freedom,<br>
Songs of freedom.<br>
