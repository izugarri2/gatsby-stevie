Ah ah listen everybody, specially you girls<br>
Is it right to be left alone when the one you love is neverhome<br>
I love too hard my friends sometimes say<br>
But I believe I believe that a woman should be loved that way<br>
But it hurts me so inside to see you treat me so unkind<br>
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't fair<br>
Can I get a witness<br>
I want a witness<br>
Somebody<br>
I want a witness<br>
Is it right to be treated so bad when you give her everythingyou had<br>
Keep on talking in my sleep 'cause I haven't seen mybaby all week<br>
Now you kids you all agree is that the way it's supposed tobe<br>
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Up early in the morning with her on my mind<br>
Took to find it out all night I been cryin'<br>
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend<br>
I'm gonna stick by hr till the very end<br>
Well she causes so much misery how's a gal supposed tobe<br>
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't right<br>
Can I get a witness, can I get a witness<br>
I want a witness<br>
Somebody<br>
Can I get a witness<br>
Everybody knows especially you girls<br>
That a love can be sad but my be loved's twice as bad<br>
Now you kids do all agree that ain't the way it's supposed to be<br>
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I want a witness<br>
I want a witness<br>
Yeah, I want a witness<br>
Somebody<br>
Is it right to be treated so bad when you give her everything you had<br>
Keep on talking in my sleep 'cause I haven't seen mybaby all week<br>
Now you kids you all agree is that the way it's supposed tobe<br>

Can you picture mother earth in the palm of your hand?<br>
The entire universe as a tiny grain of sand<br>
And it feels impossible to do<br>
As I can't imagine love without you<br>
<br>
Think of drinking every sea with its salty waters dry<br>
Sprinting 'round the world three times faster than a rocketflies<br>
And the thought of it you can't pursue<br>
As I can't imagine love without you<br>
<br>
Some thoughts are just no brainers<br>
Not worth an ounce of time<br>
Yet others inconceivable<br>
So they never cross your mind<br>
<br>
Travel back though life inside one Atlantis summer's night<br>
Add up every single star<br>
Since the day there first was light<br>
How and where to start<br>
You'll have no clue<br>
As I can't imagine love without you<br>
<br>
Yet others inconceivable<br>
So they never cross your mind<br>
Travel back though life inside one Atlantis summer's night<br>
Add up every single star<br>
Since the day there first was light<br>
How and where to start<br>
You'll have no clue<br>
And the thought of it you can't pursue<br>
'Cause it feels impossible to do<br>
As I can't imagine love without you<br>
I can't imagine love without you<br>

You just could not know how long we tried<br>
To see how this building looks inside<br>
This must be a lucky day for me<br>
Because the sign says there's a vacancy<br>
Look I know you came a long way<br>
But you made it just too late<br>
So we had to give it to somebody else<br>
Well I talked to you on the phone less than fifteen minutes ago<br>
And you told me that it was cool<br>
I graduated from Howard U.<br>
My job is paying good money too<br>
And if you check on my resume<br>
You'll find they all wanted me to stay<br>
<br>
Well I can't take the time out<br>
To check your credit card<br>
'Cause the computer just broke down today<br>
Well I'll stop by here tomorrow to complete our interview<br>
But I know what you're gonna say<br>
I know what your bottomline is<br>
<br>
You might have the cash but you<br>
Can...not cash in your face<br>
We don't want you living in here<br>
Say you might have the cash but you<br>
Can...not cash in your face<br>
We don't want your kind living in here<br>
Too-oo, Too-oo too bad,<br>
Too-oo, too-oo too sad<br>
<br>
Our first child is due here any day<br>
That's why we're desperate for a place to stay<br>
The location is so perfect too<br>
So please try to do what you can do<br>
<br>
Well in this apartment complex no children are allowed<br>
And if you told me that I could have saved you alot of time<br>
Well I thought the Bill was passed that said you could not discriminate<br>
But I know some excuse you'll find<br>
Because your bottom line is<br>
<br>
You might have the cash but you<br>
Can...not cash in your face<br>
We don't want you living in here<br>
Say you might have the cash but you<br>
Can...not cash in your face<br>
We don't want your kind living in here<br>
Aye, you might be a great doctor<br>
You might be a great lawyer<br>
You might possess the key to the city<br>
Or maybe a politician<br>
You might have the cash but you<br>
Can...not cash in your face<br>
We don't want you living in here<br>
Say you might have the cash but you<br>
Can...not cash in your face<br>
We don't want your kind living in here <br>

People goin' round<br>
Tellin' others they are square<br>
Around and round in circles<br>
Is a ride that goes somewhere<br>
All you need to fly<br>
Is a heart dying to try<br>
A chemical love<br>
It's a chemical love<br>
<br>
Ain't nothin to it<br>
Gettin' cash when you are broke<br>
Doin' lots of time<br>
Is worth a little snort of coke<br>
Infected needles<br>
Can aid you in no time<br>
Through chemical love<br>
You've got a chemical love<br>
<br>
Some people crave for physical love<br>
Some people crave material love<br>
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love<br>
You've got a chemical jones<br>
You've got a chemical love<br>
<br>
Yeah, a chemical love<br>
You've got chemical love<br>
<br>
Some people find themselves hooked on the<br>
weirdest things<br>
That have nothing to do with living<br>
God's gift to us is our life what's ours to him<br>
If it's not our love, then nothing's given, given<br>
<br>
Some people crave for physical love<br>
Some people crave material love<br>
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love<br>
You've got a chemical jones<br>
For a chemical love<br>
<br>
Yes it's true<br>
The best things in life are free<br>
Not material<br>
Chemical or physically<br>
Try it for yourself<br>
You'll get a guaranteed high<br>
From spiritual love, natural miracle drug<br>
<br>
Some people crave for physical love<br>
Some people crave material love<br>
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love<br>
You've got a chemical jones<br>
You've got a chemical love<br>
<br>
You've got a chemical love<br>
For a chemical drug<br>
<br>
Some people crave for physical love<br>
Some people crave material love<br>
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love<br>
You need a spiritual jones<br>
For that spiritual love<br>

I'm talking to you<br>
We all could do with spiritual jones<br>
For some spiritual love<br>

<div align=left><font size="3" color=#CCFFFF>
Feelin young and full of fun<br>
Hangin out with my crew<br>
Hot to trot and about to pop<br>
Tryin to find some girl to get into<br>
<br>
There she was fine as can be<br>
Hair braided down to her knees<br>
She took me home, she turned me out<br>
But before sunrise she said I must leave<br>
<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer night<br>
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer day<br>
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer morn<br>
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer eve<br>
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees<br>
<br>
I was feeling so trusting<br>
Gave it all right down to the bone<br>
But she did me wrong<br>
On a summer night<br>
<br>
Far from meek, and feelin chic<br>
Refusing to concede defeat<br>
There I was same crew, same time<br>
Same club we kicked it at the previous week<br>
<br>
I asked her how could she have the nerve<br>
To treat me with such disgrace<br>
She blinked her eyes, smiled, apologized<br>
Threw her drink right in my face<br>
<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer night<br>
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer day<br>
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer morn<br>
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer eve<br>
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees<br>
<br>
I was feeling so trusting<br>
Gave it all right down to the bone<br>
But she did me wrong<br>
On a summer night, on a summer night<br>
On a summer night, on a summer night<br>
A cold chill, a cold chill, a cold chill, cold chill<br>
<br>
Weekends came and weekends passed<br>
But not the yearning in my heart<br>
And there she was to light the spark<br>
Like she did right from the very start<br>
<br>
I took no time, drove to her house<br>
Got deep into a passion high<br>
I heard a knock, the turn of a key<br>
And the voice of another guy<br>
<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer night<br>
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer day<br>
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer morn<br>
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born<br>
It was a cold chill on a summer eve<br>
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees<br>
<br>
I was feeling so trusting<br>
Gave it all right down to the bone<br>
But she did me wrong<br>
On a summer night, on a summer night<br>
On a summer night, on a summer night<br>
<br>
It was a cold chill<br>
Like standing in the deep freeze<br>
A cold chill<br>
Like when snow's above your knees<br>
Cold chill<br>
Like sitting at the north pole<br>
A cold chill<br>
Wearing not one stitch of clothes<br>
Cold chill<br>
Like a winter Chicago night<br>
A cold chill<br>
Twenty ice cubes down your back for spite<br>
Cold chill<br>
Stranded in sub-zero degrees<br>
A cold chill<br>
Layed out on the arctic sea<br>
Cold chill<br>
When your fingers get frost bite<br>
A cold chill<br>
Buried beneath ten feet of ice<br>
Cold chill<br>
Baby, that ain't so nice<br>
A cold chill <br>

The starngest thought came to me on this morning<br>
As I awake to greet the coming dawn<br>
The sun was hardly peaking through the garden<br>
It felt that with everything I was one<br>
<br>
Then I wished that I could come back as a flower<br>
As a flower<br>
As a flower<br>
How I wished that I could come back as a flower<br>
As a flower<br>
To spread the sweetness of love<br>
To spread the sweetness of love<br>
<br>
The dew had finished making love to many<br>
A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air<br>
I envied all the silence I saw growing<br>
So unmoved by things outside themselves<br>
<br>
Then how I wished that I could come back as a flower<br>
As a flower<br>
As a flower<br>
How I wished that I could come back as a flower<br>
As a flower<br>
To spread the sweetness of love<br>
<br>
How I wished that I could come back as a flower<br>
Oh as a flower<br>
As a flower<br>
How I wished that I could come back as a flower<br>
As a flower<br>
As a flower<br>
To spread the sweetness of love<br>
To spread the sweetness of love<br>
<br>
(Background)<br>
<br>
Wished that I could come back as a flower<br>
Flower<br>
Flower<br>
<br>
Wished that I could come back as a flower<br>
Flower<br>
Sweetness of love<br>

How I come back as a flower<br>

There's a girl in my life about 4' 10"<br>
She's the one who brings me morning joy<br>
And brings me joy when my day ends<br>
She says my life will never have no problems<br>
That her love cannot fix<br>
Everytime she goes into her love bag of tricks<br>
<br>
She's got everything I want<br>
Everything I need<br>
And if she ain't got it<br>
She knows how to find the remedy<br>

And she tells me<br>
<br>
Come let me make your love come down<br>
(repetir 7 veces)<br>

She says you'll never worry in your life<br>
As long as you come and let me<br>
Make your love come down<br>
I call her Miss Satisfaction<br>
Cause she keeps me satisfied<br>
She gets my automatic smile<br>
When she whispers Stevland,<br>
I love you, I love you, I love you<br>
<br>
Such a lovely world is my life<br>
Since that girl has come inside<br>
And everyday that I live<br>
I'm gonna do my best to keep her satisfied<br>

Our love will never have no problem<br>
That the both of us can't fix<br>
Cause like glue to a stamp<br>
Like gum on a shoe<br>
She and I are gonna stick<br>

She's got everything I want<br>
Everything I need<br>

Staring right at 2000 AD<br>
As if mankind's atrocities to man has no history<br>
But just a glance at life in 2000 BC<br>
We find traces of man's inhumanity to man<br>
There's no mystery<br>
<br>
All for one, one for all<br>
There's no way we'll reach our greatest heights<br>
Unless we heed the call<br>
Me for you, you for me<br>
There's no chance of world salvation<br>
Less the conversation's peace<br>
<br>
We can't pause, watch and say "no" this can't be<br>
When there's a plan by any means to have<br>
Cleansing of one's ethnicity<br>
And we shouldn't act as if we don't hear nor see<br>
Like the holocaust of six million Jews and<br>
A hundred and fifty million blacks during slavery<br>
<br>
All for one, one for all<br>
There's no way we'll reach our greatest heights<br>
Unless we heed the call<br>
Me for you, you for me<br>
There's no chance of world salvation<br>
Less the conversation's peace<br>
<br>
When publicly or privately convened<br>
May love, positivity and life's preservation<br>
be the basic theme<br>
And should you put your trust in some<br>
prophet in life<br>
Give him trust but your faith must stay<br>
with the one<br>
Who gave the ultimate sacrifice for...<br>
<br>
All for one, one for all<br>
There's no way we'll reach our greatest heights<br>
Unless we heed the call<br>
Me for you, you for me<br>
There's no chance of world salvation<br>
Less the conversation's peace (repetir)<br>

I got the blues and I don't know why<br>
Yes I am cryin'<br>
I got the blues and I'm so dissatisfied<br>
'Cause I've been cryin' through the night<br>
Tears on my pillow<br>
And I have been cryin' through the night<br>
Weeping like a weeping pillow<br>
From cryin' through the night<br>
Hear me cryin' through the night<br>
<br>
I am lonely, downhearted and sad<br>
'Cause I've lost the best woman that I ever had<br>
To a fiend of mine<br>
<br>
Just can't figure out how it could be<br>
That somebody like him could take her away from me<br>
And it's on my mind<br>
Nearly all the time<br>
<br>
Yes I am cryin'<br>
I got the blues and I don't know why<br>
Yes I am cryin'<br>
I got the blues and I'm so dissatisfied<br>
'Cause I've been cryin' through the night<br>
Tears on my pillow<br>
And I have been cryin' through the night<br>
Weeping like a weeping pillow<br>
From cryin' through the night<br>
Hear me cryin' through the night<br>
<br>
Now I know just how best friends can be<br>
'Cause he made sure you knew your best was with me<br>
And it's on my mind<br>
<br>
Here's a lesson much greater than wealth<br>
Keep your business to you, yourself and no one else<br>
And your smiling eyes<br>
Won't be cryin' like mine<br>
<br>
Yes I am cryin'<br>
I got the blues and I don't know why<br>
Yes I am cryin'<br>
I got the blues and I'm so dissatisfied<br>
'Cause I've been cryin' through the night<br>
Tears on my pillow<br>
And I have been cryin' through the night<br>
Weeping like a weeping pillow<br>
From cryin' through the night<br>
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh<br>
I'm weeping like a weeping pillow<br>
From cryin' through the night<br>
Oh, Oh, yeah<br>
Hear me cryin', cryin', I'm cryin', cryin'<br>
I'm cryin' baby, cryin' baby, yeah<br>
Even a fool can tell<br>
That so many tears sho' enough done fell<br>
And pretty soon before you know<br>
I'll have enough tears to fill a water well<br>
Hear me cryin' through the night<br>
Oh yeah, cryin' through the night<br>
<br>
And it's on my mind<br>
Nearly all the time<br>
<br>
Yes I am cryin'<br>
I got the blues and I don't know why<br>
Yes I am cryin'<br>
I got the blues and I'm so dissatisfied<br>
'Cause I've been cryin' through the night<br>
Tears on my pillow<br>
And I have been cryin' through the night<br>
Weeping like a weeping pillow<br>
From cryin' through the night<br>
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh<br>
I'm weeping like a weeping pillow<br>
Oh, Oh, cryin' tears, cryin' tears<br>
Through the night <br>

Mmm<br>
On the beach where young lovers meet<br>
You can see them there as they sit and build<br>
Castles in the sand<br>
<br>
Heavenly she's so heavenly<br>
When she smiles at you<br>
And she helps you build castles in the sand<br>
<br>
The time comes when you stop pretending<br>
For all dreams must come to an ending<br>
Remember what happens to castles of sand<br>
The sea will wash them away<br>
Oh<br>
<br>
And the beach where they used to meet<br>
By the sand and sea waves have washed away<br>
Castles in the sand<br>
Castles in the sand<br>
Where did they go<br>
Castles in the sand<br>
Tell me, where did they go<br>
Castles in the sand<br>
I wanna know where did they go<br>

God's blessed lived, stays the weary and wild<br>
This Christmastime, keep its magic right here<br>

Lonely, my life used to be lonely<br>
Lonely like the lonely single number one<br>
Lonely like a lonely sun<br>
Without a single iota to shine upon<br>
Crying, deep inside I was crying<br>
Like the muddy Mississippi, my tears flowed<br>
Carrying with it my lonely soul<br>
Leaving no clue of who,<br>
where or what I would become<br>
Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody<br>
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life<br>
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light shine in my body<br>
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and<br>
you in my, my, my li-li-life<br>
Im dancing to the rhythms of your love<br>
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love<br>
Forever grateful for your love<br>
Money, oh how did I have money<br>
Enough to last me from start til the end of time<br>
With some more to leave behind<br>
And yet I was a cent-less pauper in distress<br>
I can, feel the very presence of your love here<br>
Though Ive never seen the pleasure of your smile<br>
No, Ive never touched your hand<br>
And yet youve given me eternal happiness<br>
Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody<br>
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life<br>
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light shine in my body<br>
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and<br>
you in my, my, my li-li-life<br>
Im dancing to the rhythms of your love<br>
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love<br>
Forever grateful for your sweet, sweet love<br>
Im dancing to the rhythms of your love<br>
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love<br>
Forever grateful for your sweet,sweet, love<br>
Im dancing to the rhythms of your love<br>
Forever grateful for your love<br>
Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody<br>
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life<br>
Oh, was I lifted when I let Gods light shine in my body<br>
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you<br>
in my, my, my li-li-life<br>
Im dancing to the rhythms of your love<br>
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love<br>
Giving all praises for your sweet, sweet love<br>
Im dancing to the rhythms of your love<br>
Forever grateful for your love<br>

There is a place<br>
On heart's motherland<br>
Where a people<br>
Die in bantu stands<br>
Manchild at eight<br>
Will face guns of hate<br>
Womanchild's fate<br>
Is life second rate<br>
<br>
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely<br>
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely<br>

They do a dance<br>
Called Mbaqana jive<br>
Rainbow people<br>
Dancin' to stay alive<br>
After hours<br>
Party hand in hand<br>
After Shebeen<br>
Terror strikes again<br>

Watch our world turn<br>
To help those in pain<br>

Aaah...<br>
Did I hear you say you love me<br>
Well baby I've got to know<br>
'Cause if you really really love me<br>
You've got to do things to show<br>
Don't give me the wrong impression<br>
By showing me warm expressions<br>
Put me in the right direction<br>
With tender love and affection<br>
I've been standing on the outside<br>
Trying to get on the inside<br>
<br>
Did I hear you say you need me<br>
Well baby tell me the truth<br>
'Cause if you really really need me<br>
My sweetness here's what I'll do<br>
Cut out all my crazy playing<br>
'Cause for your love I have been laying<br>
Just tell me that is what you're saying<br>
And I'll be yours without delaying<br>
I've been standing on the outside<br>
Trying to get on the inside<br>
<br>
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say<br>
I love you<br>

Sounds so good<br>
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say<br>
I love you<br>
<br>
Did I hear you say you want me<br>
Now please don't give me no mess<br>
'Cause if you really really want me<br>
You've got to give me your best<br>
Put my love life right in the pocket<br>
And dare someone to try to top it<br>
And when you think I want to drop it<br>
Just love me 'til I beg don't stop it<br>
'Cause I've been standing on the outside<br>
Trying to get on the inside<br>
<br>
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say<br>
I love you<br>
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say<br>
I love you<br>
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh<br>

When I see you on the street<br>
My whole body gets weak<br>
When you're standing in a crowd<br>
Your love talks to me so loud<br>
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you<br>

Seems to drive my head insane<br>

(Keita) Show me how to do like you<br>
(Aisha) If you say please<br>
(Keita) Please<br>
<br>
Since age one Keita knew he had the answer<br>
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer<br>
And with help from his sis<br>
Surely that boy would not miss<br>
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood<br>
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping<br>
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping<br>
To where music would play<br>
To his sister he would say<br>
Before his father said hey boy get right back in that bed<br>
<br>
Show me how to do like you<br>
Show me how to do it<br>
Show me how to do like you<br>
Show me how to do it<br>

Show me how to do like you<br>
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock<br>
Show me how to do it<br>
- Can you rock can you rock<br>
Show me how to do like you<br>
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock<br>
<br>
Once at school they put on a talent contest<br>
To find out who could really boogy the best<br>
But his mama said no<br>
Keita's much too young to go<br>
But his sister said please let him go so the world can see<br>
When they saw him they said he must be crazy<br>
Look at him he ain't nothing but a baby<br>
But soon as he began<br>
You knew the contest he would win<br>
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer<br>
<br>
Show me how to do like you<br>
Show me how to do it<br>
Show me how to do like you<br>
Show me how to do it<br>

Isolated junk yard<br>
Letting out the garbage<br>
Eating through the core of life<br>

Sweet fragrance irritates<br>
In a state room death awaits<br>
Persecute your own self-pride<br>

Suffocate the new high<br>
Ride the thorny mule that cries<br>
"Dig your grave and step right in"<br>
<br>
Like a judas pay the price<br>
30 pieces for a ride<br>
Here's the fire take a chew<br>
<br>
Do yourself a favour<br>
Educate your mind<br>
Get yourself together<br>

He and his wife have had problems<br>
That he's played off like nothing's wrong<br>
'Til he comes home from work early<br>
Just to find the girl is gone<br>
Oh but he gets into the cupboard<br>
Picks out that bottle of gin<br>
Drinks like there's no tomorrow<br>
And decides to take a spin<br>

Teenager at a live party<br>

But bartender says, "I don't think so"<br>
Young one says, "I can deal"<br>
Staggering out he says, "check you all later"<br>
But I really don't think he will<br>

You never see, the little sparkle, in my eye<br>
I wonder why<br>
Sometimes I wish, you stop and hold me, but you pass right by<br>
I wonder why<br>
I tried, everything I could, I even change my walk, the way that I stood<br>
But you, pass by me, and pretend that you don't, even see me<br>
But I want you to know (Uuuummmm)<br>
If one day you decide to smile, and say hello and I say goodbye (Uuuummmm)<br>
Don't wonder why my baby (no) Don't wonder why my baby<br>
<br>
When I think of how you hurt me, it brings the tears, to my eyes<br>
I just can't seem to make you happy, no matter how hard I try<br>
I wonder why<br>
Seems like, no matter what I do, it's never good, enough for you<br>
My pain, it shows loud, but it still can't let go now, but I want you to know, now<br>
Nights grow old and winds blow cold, so old if my loves grows cold<br>
And I, don't wonder why my baby (woooo)baby don't wonder why<br>
Oh yeah!<br>
<br>
(Yeaaahhh) Seems like, no matter what I do, i'am never, never, never, never, never good enough for you<br>
My pain it shows loud, oh you know I still just no matter I just can't let go now, but I want you to know!!!<br>
Love me bab<br>
Nights grow old and winds blow cold, and so old, if my love grows cold<br>
And I've, don't wonder why bab<br>
No, no, no, no, don't wonder why my baby<br>
Baby don't wonder why, don't wonder why my baby<br>
Don't wonder why ,my baby<br>
No, no, no, no don't wonder why my baby (Ooohhh)<br>
don't wonder why my baby<br>
Can you hear me, can you hear me<br>

Everybody's got a thing<br>
But some don't know how to handle it<br>
Always reachin' out in vain<br>
Accepting the things not worth having but<br>
<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama<br>
Cause I'll be standing on the side<br>
When you check it out<br>
<br>
They say your style of life's a drag<br>
And that you must go other places<br>
But just don't you feel too bad<br>
When you get fooled by smiling faces but<br>
<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama<br>
Cause I'll be standing on the side<br>
When you check it out...<br>
When you get off... your trip<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing...<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing...ooh<br>
<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama<br>
Cause I'll be standing on the side<br>
When you check it out...<br>
When you get off... your trip<br>
<br>
Everybody needs a change<br>
A chance to check out the new<br>
But you're the only one to see<br>
The changes you take yourself through but<br>
<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama<br>
Cause I'll be standing in the wings<br>
When you check it out<br>
<br>
Don't you worry 'bout a thing<br>

It brings a tear,<br>
Into my eyes,<br>
When I begin,<br>
To realize,<br>
I've cried so much,<br>
Since you've been gone,<br>
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears,<br>
I sit and cry,<br>
Just like a child<br>
My pouring tears<br>
Are runnin' wild<br>
If you don't think<br>
You'll be home soon<br>
I guess I'll drown in my own tears<br>
I know it's true<br>
Into each life<br>
Some rain, rain must pour<br>
I'm so blue<br>
Here without you<br>
It keeps raining<br>
More and more<br>
Why don't you<br>
Come on home<br>
Oh yes so I won't<br>
Be all alone<br>
If you don't think<br>
You'll be home soon<br>
I guess I'll<br>
(drown in my own tears)<br>
Ooh, don't let me<br>
(drown in my own tears)<br>
When I'm in trouble, baby<br>
(drown in my own tears)<br>
Oh, yeah, baby don't let me<br>
(drown in my own tears)<br>
I guess I'll drown in my own tears<br>
Oh, mmmmm.<br>

<div align=left><font size="3" color=#CCFFFF>
Down to earth once again<br>
I've been away too long<br>
I got lost but then<br>
I came home again<br>
Home where I belong<br>
<br>
Down to earth just in time<br>
To the love I failed to see<br>
I gave up a dream<br>
For a change of scene<br>
Now I'm back where I should be<br>
<br>
Down to earth, Down to earth<br>
All that I have lost I have found<br>
What's it worth this bitter earth<br>
Without your love around<br>
<br>
I got lost in the crowd<br>
That's the price I had to pay<br>
'Cause I couldn't find<br>
What I left behind<br>
'Til love showed me the way<br>
<br>
Yeah, Down to earth, down to earth<br>
All that I lost I have found<br>
Now What's it worth, this bitter bitter bitter earth<br>
Without your love around<br>
<br>
Welcome home little fool<br>
And it's been a long hard climb<br>
From a world unreal to the things I feel<br>
Where love was waiting all the time<br>
<br>
Down to earth, down to earth<br>
Down, down to earth yeah yeah.<br>

Dream that's the thing to do<br>
Just watch the smoke rings in-n the air<br>
You'll find your share of memories there<br>

So dream when the day is thr-ou-gh<br>
Dream and they might come true<br>
Things are never as bad as they seem<br>
So dream dream dream<br>

Folks all around dance to the sound<br>
Of the big beat<br>
It's a thrill to see this<br>
My pleasure to share it with you<br>
Don't you feel it<br>
<br>
From around the nation radio stations<br>
Play the top hits night and day<br>
And when I hear that beat<br>
I just bounce in my seat<br>
Don't you feel it<br>
Don't you feel it<br>
<br>
With the songs they play for you<br>
Just sing your blues away<br>
For my dreams you help come true<br>
Thanks to all of you and you and you<br>
<br>
Just pouring in from our distant friends<br>
France to Hong Kong<br>
They all wanna know<br>
What Makes me go<br>
I just feel it<br>
Don't you feel it<br>
<br>
They all wanna know<br>
What Makes me go<br>
I just feel it<br>
Don't you feel it<br>
Don't you feel it<br>
Yeah, yeah yeah<br>
