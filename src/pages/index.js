          <Themed.p>
            I love disc golf. I started playing in 2001 in Manitowoc, WI, and
            I've been playing ever since.

            Now I play in golf in the Jacksonville, FL area. I play mostly in
            leagues or for fun, but I have played some professional golf, with
            very limited success.

          <Themed.p>
            I write software professionally and for fun. Most of my work has
            revolved around web development, which means I use quite a lot of
            JavaScript. I think it would be most accurate to label myself a
            JavaScript Developer.

          <Themed.p>
            Because I've been at this a while, though, I'm also a full stack
            developer. I've done quite a lot with Java (mostly Spring Boot) and
            AWS.

          <Themed.p>
            I enjoy writing clean, optimal and well tested code (ty{" "}
