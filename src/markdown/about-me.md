Hi I am Bilgehan. I have been interested in computers and software since early ages. Computers are always a passion for me through the years. When I was a child I was absolutely attracted by Computer games and later it was programming. In my further education period, I have chosen to study Computer Science because I am fascinated by how computers work and I spend most of my spare time designing programs and web pages because I enjoy problem solving, being a curator and innovator person.

Lately I am focusing on Frontend Development Path to create end-to-end websites and web applications. Currently I am a Frontend Engineer at Bumper. My role is to write and style the front-end and back-end components that meet the requirements of our mocks and fulfill our user stories.
